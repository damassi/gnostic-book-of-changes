     <p align="center"><strong>Judgment </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Progress and freedom of action are found in <strong><em>Return</em></strong><em>. </em>Goings and comings are unimpeded, and friends approach without error. Return to repeat the proper course. Seven days returns the cycle to its beginning. There is advantage in choosing one's path. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong><strong><em>Return</em></strong>. Success. Going out and coming in without error. Friends come without blame. To and fro goes the way. On the seventh day comes return. It furthers one to have somewhere to go. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong><strong><em>Return.</em></strong> Success! All going forth and coming in is free from harm. <em>[For it is only when the whole series is completed that we can understand the reasons for many things (death, winter and so on) which, at the time, seemed unproductive, negative or positively evil.]</em> Friends arrive and no error is involved. They return whence they came, spending seven days in all upon their coming and returning. It is favorable to have in view some goal (or destination). </p>
     <p><strong> Liu:</strong><strong><em>Return:</em></strong>success. One goes out and comes back in without harm. Friends arrive without blame. Going to and fro is the way. Returning on the seventh day. It benefits one to go anywhere<em>. [Return or Revival signifies a bad time becoming better... Anyone receiving this hexagram should prepare for a great opportunity...] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong><strong><em>Returning,</em></strong> Growing. Issuing-forth, entering, without affliction. Partnering coming, without fault. Reversing Returning one's tao. The seventh day coming: Returning. Harvesting: possessing directed going. <em>[This hexagram describes your situation in terms of something that is re-emerging. It emphasizes that going back to the starting point in order to begin anew is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the times you are told to return!] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy:</strong><strong><em>Returning:</em></strong> Receipt; in exiting and entering there is no illness; when the burying comes there is no trouble; turning around and returning to its way, in seven days it comes in return; beneficial to have someplace to go. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): <em>Return</em></strong> is developmental. Exiting and entering, there is no ill. When a companion comes, there is no fault. Reversing the path, returning in seven days, it is beneficial to have a place to go. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2):</strong><strong><em>Return</em></strong> is successful, etc. &hellip; Returning back on the path, etc. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu:</strong><strong><em>Renewal </em></strong>is pervasive. He who comes and goes will have no error. Friends come without harm. The course repeats itself. In seven days, one cycle of reversion completes. There will be advantage to have an undertaking. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>The Image </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> Thunder in the middle of the earth -- the image of <strong><em>Return</em></strong><em>.</em> Thus the ancient kings closed the passes on the day of the winter solstice to prevent travelers from pursuing their journeys, and princes from inspecting their states. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong> Thunder within the earth: the image of <strong><em>The Turning Point.</em></strong> Thus the kings of antiquity closed the passes at the time of the solstice. Merchants and strangers did not go about, and the ruler did not travel through the provinces. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong> This hexagram symbolizes thunder in the bowels of the earth. <em>[The component trigrams in this position suggest thunder coming from under the earth; but the trigram of thunder also means to sprout or quicken; it is this concept of a quickening within the earth that makes this hexagram generally favorable.]</em> The ancient rulers closed the passes during the solstices <em>[The solstices were times for solemn sacrifice; it has always been the practice in China for people to return to their homes for the celebration of the great yearly festivals. Return in this sense is highly auspicious.]</em> and the merchants were unable to travel. Even the rulers abstained from touring their territories at those times. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu:</strong> Thunder in the earth symbolizes <strong><em>Return.</em></strong> Thus in ancient times the kings closed the roads during the winter solstice. Merchants and travelers ceased traveling. And rulers would not visit their territories. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Thunder located-in earth center. <strong><em>Returning.</em></strong> The Earlier Kings used culminating sun to bar the passages. Bargaining sojourners [used culminating sun] not to move. The crown-prince [used culminating sun] not to inspect on-all- sides. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): </strong> Thunder is in the earth; <strong><em>Return.</em></strong> Thus did the kings of yore shut the gates on the winter solstice; caravans did not travel, the ruler did not inspect the regions. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu:</strong> Thunder is inside the earth; this is <strong><em>Renewal.</em></strong> Thus on the day of the winter solstice, the ancient kings ordered the city gates closed, so that merchants and travelers could take a break of their journeys; the kings refrained from performing official duties. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong><strong><em>Return</em></strong> shows the coming back of the dynamic principle. His actions show movement directed in accordance with the natural order. Such is the movement of the heavenly cycle. The dynamic lines are growing and increasing. Do we not see in<strong><em>Return</em></strong> the mind of heaven and earth? </p>
     <p><strong> Legge: <em>Return</em></strong> symbolizes the idea of coming back or over again. The previous hexagram showed the ascendancy of inferior forces, when all that is good in nature or society yields before what is bad. But change is eternal, and here we see the beginnings of recovery from the former situation. <strong><em>Return</em></strong> is associated with the time of the winter solstice when the sun begins its journey back toward summer. In harmony with these cycles in nature are the cycles in human affairs. </p>
     <p> The dynamic bottom line is the first line of the trigram of Movement, and the upper trigram is that of Docility. The dynamic returning line will meet with no resistance and all the magnetic lines above it will be transformed into allies. The bright quality will be developed brighter and brighter from day to day and month to month. </p>
     <p><em>&quot;In seven days brings return&quot;</em> refers to the idea of a new cycle commencing when each of the six lines of a hexagram has changed -- the <em>&quot;seventh line,&quot;</em> or seventh day begins a new cycle just as Sunday begins a new week. </p>
     <p> Thunder in the midst of the earth is thunder shut up and silent, just able to make its presence felt. So it is with the first stirrings of life after the winter solstice and the first returning steps of the wanderer to virtue. As the spring of life has to be nurtured in quietness, so also the purpose of goodness. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm:</strong> The hexagram of RETURN, applied to character formation, contains various suggestions. The light principle returns; thus the hexagram counsels turning away from the confusion of external things, turning back to one&rsquo;s inner light. There, in the depths of the soul, one sees the Divine, the One. It is indeed only germinal, no more than a beginning, a potentiality, but as such clearly to be distinguished from all objects. To know this One means to know oneself in relation to the cosmic forces. For this One is the ascending force of life in nature and in man. </p>

     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Judgment: </strong> The Work is recycled, perfected and refined over and over again. </p>
     <p><strong> The Superior Man</strong> pauses before he begins anew. </p>
     <p> The mention of seven days in the Judgment and the winter solstice in the Image tells us that the hexagram of <strong><em>Return</em></strong> deals with cyclic progression. </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> In the<strong> I Ching, </strong>the hexagram fu, signifying the Return (one yang line beneath five yin lines) is the symbol of the rebirth of the Yang. At the winter solstice, the Yang seems to have disappeared, whereas the Yin is at its full; but this is the moment when the Yang is reborn and begins its return. Symmetrically, at the summer solstice the Yang is at the apogee of its power while the Yin prepares to return. The alteration of the Yin and the Yang is a going away and a coming back. <br>
         </em>Max Kaltenmark -- <strong><em>Lao Tzu and Taoism</em></strong></p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p> Seven days is one-quarter of a lunar cycle and the module upon which a week is based. The Sabbath day is the seventh day and a day of rest in the Hebrew tradition, as was also the day of the new moon. The <em>&quot;closing of the passes&quot;</em> in the Image is another expression of the idea of resting at the beginning of a new cycle. To refrain from activity at these times was a sacrifice and a spiritual obligation. The concept behind it is the acknowledgment of one's Source, a review of the past cycle and a meditation upon the new cycle just beginning. Psychologically interpreted, forces in the unconscious psyche demand a pause before their dance can resume. </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> A special atmosphere of solemn celebration surrounded the Sabbath, which was thoroughly pervaded with Kabbalistic ideas about man's role in the unification of the upper worlds. <br>
         </em>Gershom Scholem -- <strong><em>Kabbalah</em></strong></p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p> Although the Chinese observed no &ldquo;Sabbath&rdquo; that I am aware of, the idea of a rest at the commencement of a cycle is clearly intended in this hexagram. In terms of the Work, one eventually becomes aware of cycles and rest periods, even if one never noticed them previously. When one learns how to synchronize conscious awareness with these inner rhythms, the tempo of the Work begins to accelerate. </p>
     <p><em>&quot;There is advantage in choosing one's path&quot;</em> is rendered by Wilhelm as: <em>&quot;It furthers one to have somewhere to go.&quot;</em> The idea is that when you are consciously on a path, the cycles begin to work in your favor. Instead of a monotonous round of inconclusive and random events, one's life takes on structure and purpose and inner progress becomes discernable. </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> Conforming to the rhythm of the universe is the prerequisite of wisdom in all Chinese thinking. But the Taoist mystic has greater ambitions than his ordinary compatriots: the question for him is not merely of adapting his ritual and hygienic observances to the alternation of the seasons; he intends to escape from the determinism of life and death by transcending it. This is what enables him to attain inner emptiness: he does not merely witness the return of all creatures to their origin, he precedes them to that origin. <br>
         </em>Max Kaltenmark<em> --<strong> Lao Tzu and Taoism </strong></em></p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p> Every line of this hexagram refers to returning to the proper path, so the hexagram can imply that perhaps you have strayed from the Work to one degree or another. Without changing lines, it can mean to rest at the beginning of a cycle, or to get back on course: re-attune yourself with the current phase of the Work. </p>

     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: </strong> Returning from an error of no great extent is the prelude to the cultivation of the person. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong>Thus one cultivates one's character. <strong>Blofeld:</strong> Turning back before having gone too far is a means of self-discipline. <strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Using adjusting individuality indeed. <strong>Cleary (2): </strong>Returning that is not far is done by cultivating oneself. <strong>Wu:</strong> To return before wandering far is a way of cultivating oneself. </p>
     <p><strong>The Master said:</strong><em>I may venture to say that the son of the Yen family </em>[Yen Hui, Confucius' favorite disciple] <em>had nearly attained the standard of perfection. If anything that he did was not good, he was sure to become conscious of that; and when he knew it, he did not do the same thing again. As is said in the <strong>I Ching</strong>, &quot;The first line shows its subject returning from </em><em>an error that has not led him far away. There is no occasion for repentance. There will be great good.&quot; </em></p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The subject of line one is the only dynamic line in the hexagram, meaning here, says Ch'eng-tzu, <em>&quot;the way of the superior man.&quot;</em> There must have been some deviation from that, or <em>&quot;returning&quot;</em> could not be spoken of. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> At the outset, the man returns to the original course of goodness after a minor setback. There is no cause for remorse since the evil is put aside quickly. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> You may be considering an idea that is by nature contrary to your principles. Exercise self-discipline and hold to what you feel is right. In this way you cultivate your character and will surely attain great things. </p>

     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> This is due to her condescension to the virtuous subject of the line below. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> The good fortune of a quiet return depends on subordination to a good man. <strong>Blofeld: </strong>This good fortune results from our treating others with loving-kindness. <strong> Ritsema/Karcher: </strong>Using humanity below indeed. <strong>Cleary (2): </strong>Comes through humble benevolence. <strong>Wu:</strong> (This) is due to his submission to the one having the love for mankind. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> Line two is in its proper place and central, but it is magnetic. This is more than compensated for by its adherence to line one -- the fifth line not being a proper correlate. Hence her return is called excellent or admirable. The virtuous subject of the first line is in line two called<strong></strong><em>zhen,</em> the &quot;benevolent&quot; or &quot;loving.&quot; It is the only case in all the symbolism of the<strong><em>I Ching</em></strong>where we find that term used as an adjective. It is emphatic here for &quot;Humanity&quot; -- man in his ideal state. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> The man makes an admirable comeback through an act of self-mastery. </p>

     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> The meaning of the line is derived from its allegiance to line number one. This can be interpreted as subordination to a high ideal or principle of integration. If we consider Legge's commentary on the concept of <em>zhen</em><strong></strong>as love in the highest sense of unity/union, then the line suggests a return to a principle of love, unity or even the Supreme Ultimate itself. </p>

     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> Notwithstanding her many returns there will be no error because she aims after righteousness. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong>The danger of repeated return is, in its essential meaning, deliverance from blame. <strong>Blofeld: </strong>This means that we are in no way to blame for the trouble. <strong>Ritsema/ Karcher: </strong>Righteous, without fault indeed. <strong>Cleary (2): </strong>The diligence of repeated return is faultless if right. <strong>Wu: </strong>The peril of repeatedly losing Return is in principle blameless. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> Line three is magnetic in the dynamic place at the top of the trigram of Movement. Any evil issue may be prevented by caution and awareness of danger. </p>

     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> The man is changeable, departing time after time from the right course because of his uncontrolled desire for apparent advantages and returning to it for seemingly better solutions. No great blame will be attached to him, but there is still some danger. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> This position indicates the type of person who is constantly vacillating because of the imagined advantages of other paths. This kind of experimentation could be dangerous, but is mostly an annoyance to all concerned. It is indicated that the situation will improve nevertheless. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> Implicit here is the idea that there are many lessons to be learned and reinforced when one undertakes the Work, and uncertainty and vacillation are to be expected. Often we expect more of ourselves than we are capable of performing. One doesn't learn how to be a mountain climber by immediately attempting to scale Mt. Everest. The Work is a task of many lifetimes, involving the step by step integration of countless disparate complexes within the psyche. Occasionally we may get off the path, but as long as we remain committed to the Work we must always return -- hopefully having learned something from our temporary detour. This is not a justification for a failure of willpower, but it is a recognition that such failures exist here in the World of the Senses. Blofeld's interpretation of the Confucian commentary can be misleading -- the <em>&quot;no blame&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;no error&quot;</em> proviso in the original line derives from our recognition that we have gotten off the path and are determined to return to it, not usually that we are entirely free of culpability. On the other hand, the line can sometimes represent a recurring issue in which personal blame is not an obvious factor: one just has to deal with it until it&rsquo;s resolved. (For example, a problem which others have not integrated, that they keep pushing on you.) In its most negative interpretation, the line images a chronic condition. </p>

     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: </strong> Her object is to pursue the proper path. <strong>Wilhelm/ Baynes: </strong>One returns alone, and so follows the right way. <strong>Blofeld: </strong>This solitary return is necessary if the path of righteousness is to be followed. <strong>Ritsema/ Karcher:</strong> Using adhering-to tao indeed. <strong>Cleary (2): </strong>(This) is done by following the path. <strong>Wu:</strong> Because he follows the principle. </p>

     <p><strong> Wilhelm:</strong> &hellip; [Line four] is in the midst of weak lines, and is itself compliant and in a weak place. One might infer a lack of initiative. But the line is in the relationship of correspondence to the strong nine at the beginning, hence solitary return. </p>

     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> In an inner sense, this can refer to conflicting emotions and the correct way to deal with them. The Confucian commentary suggests the paraphrase: <em>&quot;Do what is right or proper in the situation under question.&quot;</em> This is indicated by the line&rsquo;s proper alliance with its powerful first line correlate. Wilhelm&rsquo;s commentary on the hexagram links to the symbolism of line four: &ldquo;Thus the [line] counsels turning away from the confusion of external things, turning back to one&rsquo;s inner light. There, in the depths of the soul, one sees the Divine, the One. It is indeed only germinal, no more than a beginning, a potentiality, but as such clearly to be distinguished from all objects. To know this One means to know oneself in relation to the cosmic forces.&rdquo; </p>

         <p align="justify"><em> What is it, in the end, that induces a man to go his own way and to rise out of unconscious identity with the mass as out of a swathing mist? ... It is what is commonly called vocation: an irrational factor that destines a man to emancipate himself from the herd and from its well-worn paths. True personality is always a vocation and puts its trust in it as in God, despite its being, as the ordinary man would say, only a personal feeling. But vocation acts like a law of God from which there is no escape. The fact that many a man who goes his own way ends in ruin means nothing to one who has vocation. He must obey his own law, as if it were a daemon whispering to him of new and wonderful paths. Anyone with a vocation hears the voice of the inner man: he is called. <br>

     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> A confused return -- misfortune! Disasters and injury threaten. Armies set marching, but ultimately a great defeat takes place. Disaster is about to overtake the ruler and for at least ten years there can be no hope of putting things to right. </p>

     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: </strong> Evil consequences result because the course pursued is contrary to the proper course for a ruler.<strong> Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong>The misfortune in missing the return lies in opposing the way of the superior man.<strong> Blofeld: </strong> The misfortune described here is the result of deviation from the path of the Superior Man.<em>[The omen presages very serious trouble affecting many people besides ourselves as a result of deviation from the path of virtue.]</em><strong>Ritsema/Karcher: </strong>Reversing the chief: tao indeed. <strong>Cleary (2): </strong>Turning back on the path of a leader. <strong>Wu: </strong>The proper conduct of a sovereign has been violated. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> Line six is magnetic at the top of the hexagram. The time for returning is over with, and any action she takes will lead to the evils mentioned<em>. &quot;Ten years&quot;</em> seems to be a round number signifying a long time. </p>

     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> The man attempts to gain his objectives by force. His blind obstinacy leads to calamity. The use of armies under these conditions will result in a great defeat and a long-lasting disaster for the state. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> You've missed the time to make a change for the better at the beginning of this recent cycle. This is unfortunate because you were quite capable of recognizing the need for reform. Instead, you have stubbornly locked yourself into a non-constructive attitude. You must now wait out the entire cycle before you have another chance to change. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> Line six is an unambiguous image of vacillation about the proper path, and a warning about the consequences of inferior choices. Note that Legge, Wilhelm, Liu and Wu all use the conditional <strong>&lsquo;<em>if&rsquo; </em></strong>to represent the option of military action: in other words there is still room to avoid defeat by <em>returning</em> to base rather than attacking. Hence the portent of this line is not necessarily a foregone conclusion. </p>
