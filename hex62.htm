Hook </p>

     <p align="center"><strong>Judgment </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong><strong><em>Small Powers</em></strong> indicates that there will be progress and attainment in small affairs, but not in great affairs. It will be advantageous to be firm and correct. It is like the song of a flying bird: It is better to descend than to ascend. In this way there will be good fortune. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong><strong><em>Preponderance of the Small</em></strong>. Success. Perseverance furthers. Small things may be done; great things should not be done. The flying bird brings the message: It is not well to strive upward, it is well to remain below. Great good fortune. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong><strong><em>The Small Get By</em></strong> -- success! Persistence in a righteous course brings reward. Small things can be accomplished now, but not great ones. When birds fly high, their singing is out of tune. The humble, but not the mighty, are favored now with great good fortune. <em>[To aim high now would be to put ourselves out of accord with the times.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Liu:</strong><strong><em>Slight Excess.</em></strong> Success. Continuing is of benefit. Undertaking small things, not great things. The song of the flying bird. It is not good to go up; it is good to stay below. Great good fortune. <em>[Slight Excess signifies the slight excess or small mistake that can prevent the achievement of great things.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong><strong><em>Small Exceeding</em></strong>, Growing. Harvesting Trial. Permitting Small </p>
     <p> Affairs. Not permitting Great Affairs. Flying bird: abandoning's sound. Above not proper, below proper. The great significant. <em>[This hexagram describes your situation in terms of an overwhelming variety of encounters and details. It emphasizes that an excessive concern with adapting yourself to these inner and outer events is the adequate way to handle it...] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy: <em>Small Surpassing</em></strong> : Receipt; beneficial to determine; possible for little service, but not possible for great service. The sound left by the flying bird is not proper for ascent but is proper for descent; greatly auspicious. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1):</strong><strong><em>Predominance of the small </em></strong>is developmental, beneficial if correct. It is suitable for a small affair but not for a great one. The call left by a flying bird should not rise but descend. This is very auspicious. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2):</strong><strong><em>Small excess</em></strong> turns out all right. It is beneficial to be correct. It is all right for small matters, not for great matters. A flying bird leaves its cry; it should not ascend but descend &ndash; then there will be great good fortune. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu: <em>Excess of the Small </em></strong> indicates pervasiveness and the advantage of being persevering. One may succeed in doing small business, but not big one. Like the lingering sound of a bird flying by, it is not suitable to go upward, but suitable to go downward. Great fortune. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>The Image </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The image of thunder above a hill forms <strong><em>Small Powers</em></strong>. The superior man, in accordance with this, in his conduct exceeds in humility, in mourning exceeds in sorrow, and in his expenditure exceeds in economy. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> Thunder on the mountain: the image of <strong><em>Preponderance of the Small</em></strong>. Thus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence. In bereavement he gives preponderance to grief. In his expenditures he gives preponderance to thrift. <em>[The superior man derives an imperative from this image: he must always fix his eyes more closely and more directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even though this might make his behavior seem petty to the outside world. He is exceptionally conscientious in his actions.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> This hexagram symbolizes thunder over the mountains. The Superior Man now acts with too much reverence, experiences too much sorrow from bereavement and is overly thrifty in satisfying his needs. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> Thunder over the mountain symbolizes <strong><em>Slight Excess.</em></strong> The superior man's conduct is overly humble; In mourning he laments exceedingly, and he is stingy in his spending. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Above mountain possessing thunder. <strong><em>Small Exceeding.</em></strong> A <em>chun tzu</em> uses moving Exceeding to reach-to courtesy. A <em>chun tzu</em> uses losing Exceeding to reach-to mourning. A <em>chun tzu </em>uses availing of Exceeding to reach-to parsimony. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): </strong> There is thunder over a mountain, <strong><em>exessively small.</em></strong> Thus superior people are excessively deferential in conduct, excessively sad in mourning, excessively frugal in consumption. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2): </strong> Thunder over a mountain &ndash; <strong><em>small excess.</em></strong> Genteel people are exceedingly deferential in conduct, exceedingly sad in mourning, and exceedingly abstemious in consumption. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu: </strong> Thunder rolls over the mountain; this is <strong><em>Excess of the Small.</em></strong> Thus the <em>jun zi </em>conducts himself with a little excess in respect to others, a little excess in sorrow at mourning, and a little excess in frugality in expenditure. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> In <strong><em>Small Powers</em></strong> we see the magnetic lines exceeding the others, and giving the intimation of progress and attainment. To be advantageous, such excesses must be associated with firm correctness, and must always be in harmony with the requirements of the time. The magnetic lines are in the central places, and hence it is said that small excesses may be done in small affairs with good effect. Of the dynamic lines, one is not in its proper place, and the other is not central; thus it is said that small excesses should not be done in great affairs. In the hexagram we have the symbol of the flying bird, whose song reminds us that it is better to descend than ascend. To ascend is contrary to what is reasonable in the case, while to descend is natural and right. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The meaning of this hexagram in which an excess of yin lines prevails, may be grasped by contrasting its image with that of hexagram number twenty-eight, <strong><em>Critical Mass,</em></strong> in which an excess of yang lines prevails. Here the idea is the prevalence of small or inferior powers, and the lesson to be learned is how to distinguish essentials from non-essentials. Is it ever good to deviate from the established course of procedure? The answer is that it is permissible only in small matters, but never in matters of import. Sometimes form may be dispensed with, but never substance, and the thing must always be done responsibly and with appropriate humility. The symbol of the bird is to teach humility -- it is better for it to descend, keeping near to where it can perch and rest, than to ascend into the homeless regions of the upper air. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Judgment:</strong> Ground your flights of fancy. </p>
     <p><strong> The Superior Man</strong> bends over backwards to be correct. </p>
     <p><strong><em>Small Powers</em></strong> shows the preceding figure of <strong><em>Inner Truth</em></strong> turned inside-out. Here the magnetic lines are all on the outside -- uncontained and uncontrolled. The hexagram often reflects a situation in which the &quot;archetypes&quot;: the passions, appetites, emotions, drives and instincts have left their proper places within the psyche and are flying free like birds escaped from the zoo. Most of the lines either depict the danger of such a situation or warn about how to control it. </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> In this inflated, compulsive state of identity, we and the drive are at our most harmful; the drive will unfold and we will act out its extreme, inappropriate and destructive side. In the process we get the worst of it, along with the other people involved. The wrong thing usually happens at the wrong time and in the wrong place. A capacity for moving toward differentiation and transforming the drive will not arise until the state of identity has been dissolved. This requires a confrontation of the drive as a Thou, as something that is not I, as something separate from ourselves. Only at this point can the inner dialogue begin. Until then the drive remains unconscious, primitive and destructive. Only after the identity has been dissolved by learning to experience the drive as an autonomous entity that is separate from the ego, do we get a chance to choose a right time and place and to develop the positive potential of the drive. <br>

       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p> Interestingly, the only line that seems to be correctly &quot;out of its cage&quot; is the second -- suggesting a situation in which an intuitive inner wisdom takes proper precedence over the usual firm correctness of &quot;reason.&quot; </p>
     <p class="style7"> Line-1 </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The first line, magnetic, suggests the idea of a bird flying, and ascending until the issue is evil. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> The bird meets with misfortune through flying.<em> [A bird ought to remain in the nest until it is fledged. If it tries to fly before this, it invites misfortune.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> A bird in flight brings misfortune. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> A bird encounters misfortune when it soars. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Flying bird: using a pitfall. </p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy:</strong> The flying bird brings inauspiciousness. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): </strong> A bird that flies thereby brings misfortune. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu: </strong> The flying bird gets its misfortune. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> Nothing can be done to avoid this issue. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> Here there is nothing to be done. <strong>Blofeld:</strong> There is nothing we can do about it.<em> [The bird is merely a symbol; we are due to encounter misfortune which we are powerless to avert.]</em><strong>Ritsema/Karcher: </strong>Wherefore not permitted thus indeed. <strong> Cleary (2): </strong> Nothing can be done about it.<strong> Wu:</strong> It cannot be helped. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Line one is magnetic in a dynamic place, and possessed by the idea of exceeding the limitations of the hexagram. Her correlate is the dynamic fourth line, belonging to the trigram of Movement, so that instead of being repressed from her tendency to ascend, she is actually stimulated to do so. Nothing can be done to avoid an evil issue because she brings it on herself. </p>
     <br>
     <p align="center"><strong> NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> At the outset, the man should heed the case of a bird leaving the nest before it is fledged. He should spend his early life learning the traditional ways in order to avoid wasting his energies in senseless jousting. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> If you are considering an extraordinary plan, forget it. The time and your position could not be more inappropriate. Your destiny lies in the ordinary or traditional, and anything beyond that would lead you into danger. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> Despite the gloomy Confucian commentary, my experience with this line has usually been conditional: &quot;<strong><em>If</em></strong> the bird flies, disaster is inevitable.&quot; The implicit conclusion is: &quot;If the bird <strong><em>doesn't</em></strong> fly, it will escape the unpleasant consequences.&quot; The image of the bird (an air creature symbolizes a thought, concept or idea) can suggest blue-sky thinking that will only end up lost in space. Wilhelm&rsquo;s commentary offers the idea of a fledgling trying to fly before it is ready, suggesting that the impulse to act may be more premature than improper. </p>

     <p class="style7"> Line-2 </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The second line, magnetic, shows its subject passing by her grandfather, and meeting with her grandmother; not attempting anything against her ruler, but meeting her as her minister. There will be no error. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> She passes by her ancestor and meets her ancestress. He does not reach his prince and meets the official. No blame. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong> Passing by the spirit tablets of his ancestors, he encountered the ghost of (or else the tablet of) his late mother. He did not get as far as the Prince but encountered one of the ministers -- no error! </p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> He passes over his deceased grandfather and meets his deceased grandmother. He does not reach the king but meets an official. No blame. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Exceeding one's grandfather. Meeting one's grandmother. Not extending-to one's chief. Meeting one's servant. Without fault. </p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy: </strong> Surpassing his grandfather, meeting his grandmother: Not reaching his lord, meeting his servant; there is no trouble. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): </strong> Passing the grandfather, you meet the mother; not reaching the lord, you meet the retainer. No fault.<strong></strong></p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2): </strong> Going past the grandfather, etc. ... you meet the administrator, etc. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu: </strong> He passes by his grandfather and meets with his grandmother. He does not reach the ruler, but meets with the minister. No error. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: </strong> A minister should not overpass the ruler. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong>The official should not wish to surpass the prince. <strong>Blofeld: </strong>He did not reach the Prince because he was unable to get by the minister.<em> [We fail, but through no fault of ours, to reach as high as we'd hoped.] </em><strong>Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Not extending to one's chief. A servant not permitted Exceeding indeed. <strong> Cleary (2): </strong> The administrator is not to be surpassed.<strong> Wu: </strong>Because the minister should not be bypassed. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The second line is magnetic but in her proper central place. Her correlate is the magnetic fifth-line ruler of the hexagram. The dynamic lines separating them represent her father and grandfather, but she passes by them to meet with her grandmother in line five. She moves toward the grandmother-ruler not as an enemy, but with the loyal humility of a proper minister. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> The man fails to meet the chief executive, but goes about his duties among other officials. He does not force his way into the limelight. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> Use whatever common affiliations you have with others to bring you into a secure position. No matter what kind of connection you make, it is the connection itself that is important. Hold as closely as possible, however, to traditional methods. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> Blofeld, Liu, Ritsema/Karcher (and Wilhelm by implication) all state that the &quot;grandfather&quot; and &quot;grandmother&quot; are deceased ancestors. Ritsema/Karcher translate &quot;grandmother&quot; as: <em>&quot;Second ancestor generation ... venerated as source of her many descendants.&quot;</em> Psychologically, we can assume that the &quot;ancestral grandmother&quot; relates to a primal Yin archetype. Here, a female (Eros principle) passes by two males (logos principle) to unite (correctly in this instance) with another yin line -- which also rules the hexagram. Psychologically, the image suggests the subordination of intellect to a deeper source of wisdom within the psyche. A fair paraphrase of the Confucian commentary might be: <em>&quot;Don't exceed your authority.&quot;</em> Perhaps a warning to the ego not to impose its preconceived ideas on the unusual situation portrayed by this line. If this is the only changing line, the corresponding line in the new hexagram, 32 &ndash; <strong><em>Consistency</em></strong>, is: <em> Remorse disappears</em> . The relationship between correlate lines in these two hexagrams helps explain each other. Siu&rsquo;s paraphrase in the latter case is often useful: <em>The man endures by keeping his force of character within the bounds of available power</em>. </p>

     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> The position is inappropriate for a dynamic line. If he goes forward the result would be that his course would not be long pursued. <strong>Wilhelm/ Baynes: </strong>The place is not the appropriate one.<strong> Blofeld:</strong> Accosting someone instead of passing him by is now inappropriate or, is indicated by the unsuitable position of this line. The danger of going forward and the need for precaution imply that we should not continue long in our present course. <strong>Ritsema/ Karcher: </strong> Situation not appropriate indeed. Going adversity necessarily warning. Completing not permitting long-living indeed. <strong> Cleary (2): </strong> The position is not right. After all, it cannot last.<strong> Wu:</strong> This means that his position is improper. Because it will not last. </p>

     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> The image portrays a dynamic minister who might be inclined to surpass his magnetic ruler, but who is counseled to temper his impulse to advance. <em> &quot;He meets him without passing by&quot;</em> in Wilhelm's translation is another way of saying not to ignore the danger in the situation. Legge's rendering: <em>&quot;There is no occasion to be using firmness perpetually,&quot;</em> Ritsema/Karcher's: <em>&quot;No availing-of perpetual Trial,&quot; </em>and Shaughnessy&rsquo;s <em>&quot;Do not herewith determine permanently,&quot; </em>all contradict Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu, who translate constant perseverance. The logic of the imagery and Confucian commentary argue for this latter rendering, though the circumstances of your query may leave the other interpretation open for consideration. Indeed, Cleary&rsquo;s Taoist and Buddhist translations offer each version! </p>

     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The fifth line, magnetic, suggests the idea of dense clouds, but no rain, coming from our borders in the west. It also shows the prince shooting his arrow, and taking the bird in a cave. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> Dense clouds, no rain from our western territory. The prince shoots and hits him who is in the cave. <em>[The man in the cave is line two.

     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> There are dense clouds, but no rain -- the line is in too high a place. <strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> He is already above. <strong>Blofeld: </strong>Dense clouds and no rain points to their having risen too high. <em>[Something which could have been of great help to us passes us by.]</em><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Above climaxing indeed. <strong> Cleary (2): (</strong> The clouds) have already risen.<strong> Wu: </strong>The clouds have been blown away by high winds. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> Line five, though in the ruler's seat, is magnetic, and incapable of doing anything great. It is a yin line, and too high. If the line were yang, the auspice would be different. He is called the prince because of the ruler's seat, and the bird in the cave that he captures is the subject of line two. </p>

     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> Because of the lack of able helpers, the prince is unsuccessful in his attempts to set the world in order. He searches intently for the required talents among those who have retired from the public scene. The right man with a demonstrated record of achievement is finally found and the difficult task completed. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> Your strength is adequate to bring forth that which you desire, but your position is not appropriate. You will need help from others. Modestly seek such assistance from qualified people and you can accomplish your aim. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> There are two sets of images here -- the first suggests an accumulation of latent energy and the second the grasp of something concealed. Rain symbolizes the union of heaven and earth -- the connection between higher and lower, inner and outer. Dense clouds therefore represent a buildup of unreleased tension: union has yet to be accomplished. The arrow shot into the cave with a line attached to it traditionally symbolizes the link between this line&rsquo;s magnetic second-line correlate. (Meditation on the differences between the two lines and their respective messages is often useful in discerning subtle ego/Self relationships.) The arrow suggests discrimination or comprehension -- to shoot an arrow into the heart of something is a conscious, active attempt to pierce its essence, to comprehend it. To shoot into the darkness of a cave symbolizes seeking comprehension of what is unknown or unconscious; it can also suggest &quot;a shot in the dark&quot; -- a guess. Only Legge identifies the target as a bird &ndash; the other translations are less specific: the object is &ldquo;something or someone&rdquo; hidden from consciousness. As a creature of the air, a bird represents thoughts, ideas, concepts, intelligible answers, etc. , so this often applies in the interpretation. (Note how central the bird symbol is in this hexagram.) The line suggests one seeking comprehension of an unknown situation or process and receiving relatively little satisfaction -- the answer is out of reach (<em>&quot;too high&quot;</em>) in the imagery of the Confucian commentary. If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created is Number 31, <strong><em>Influence,</em></strong> which often carries the connotation of &ldquo;importuning&rdquo; &ndash; suggesting that perhaps you are seeking information which the oracle has no intention of providing, or you are incapable of understanding at this stage: it&rsquo;s <em>too high</em>, it&rsquo;s <em>beyond you</em>. (See commentary on Hex 31 for more details.) Also compare this line with the virtually identical message in the Judgement of Hexagram 9: &rsquo;<strong><em>The</em></strong><strong><em>Taming Power of the Small </em></strong>has success. Dense clouds, no rain from our western region.&rsquo; This repetition of the theme of &rsquo;smallness&rsquo; (in all of its possible connotations) is useful to contemplate here. </p>

     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> Line six is magnetic at the top of the trigram of Movement. She is possessed by the idea of the hexagram to an extreme degree, and is incapable of keeping herself under restraint. </p>

     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> Wilhelm and Blofeld both translate <em>&quot;domineering&quot;</em> as <em>&quot;arrogance,&quot;</em> thus creating an image of rising above one's proper station (exceeding the mean) through over-confidence or pride.
