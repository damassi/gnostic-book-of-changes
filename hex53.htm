     <p align="center"><strong>Judgment </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong><strong><em>Gradual Progress</em></strong>shows the good fortune attending the marriage of a young lady. Firm correctness brings advantage. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes: <em>Development.</em></strong> The maiden is given in marriage. Good fortune. Perseverance furthers. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong><strong><em>Gradual Progress.</em></strong> The marriage of a maiden brings good fortune. Persistence in a righteous course brings reward. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu: <em>Gradual Development.</em></strong> The marriage of a girl -- Good Fortune. It benefits to continue. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong><strong><em>Infiltrating</em></strong>, womanhood converting significant. Harvesting Trial. <em>[This hexagram describes your situation in terms of gradually achieving a goal. It emphasizes that advancing through diffuse but steady penetration is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told to: infiltrate!] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy:</strong><strong><em>Advancing: </em></strong>For the maiden to return is auspicious; beneficial to determine. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2):</strong><strong><em>Gradual Progress</em></strong> in a woman&rsquo;s marriage is auspicious. It is beneficial to be chaste. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu: <em>Gradualness</em></strong> indicates that it is auspicious for a woman to get married and it is advantageous for her to be persevering. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>The Image </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> A tree on the mountain -- the image of <strong><em>Gradual Progress</em></strong><em>.</em> The superior man attains and nourishes his extraordinary virtue to improve the manners of the people. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> On the mountain, a tree: the image of <strong><em>Development.</em></strong> Thus the superior man abides in dignity and virtue, in order to improve the mores. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong> This hexagram symbolizes a tree upon a mountain. The Superior Man, abiding in holiness and virtue, inclines the people towards goodness. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> A tree on the mountain symbolizes <strong><em>Gradual Development</em></strong>. The superior man, in maintaining his virtue, improves society's customs. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher: </strong> Above mountain possessing wood. <strong><em>Infiltrating.</em></strong> A <em>chun tzu </em>uses residing-in eminent actualizing-tao to improve the vulgar. <em>[<strong>Actualize-tao: </strong> Ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos ... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is meant to be.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1):</strong> There are trees on the mountain, <strong><em>growing gradually</em></strong>. Thus do superior people abide in sagacity and improve customs. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2):</strong> &hellip;Developed people improve customs by living wisely and virtuously. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu:</strong> There are trees on the mountain; this is <strong><em>Gradualness.</em></strong> The<em> jun zi</em> chooses to live in the neighborhood known for its high moral standards and exemplary custom. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: </strong> The ascent of <strong><em>Gradual Progress</em></strong> resembles the fortunate marriage of a young lady. The lines ascend to their proper places, indicating achievement. Because the ascent is made correctly the subject of the hexagram is empowered to rectify his country. He is shown as the dynamic ruler in line five, central and correct. The alternation of Keeping Still and Flexible Penetration ensure that the advance is continuous. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The written character for <strong><em>Gradual Progress</em></strong> is ordinarily used in the sense of gradually, but there is connected with it also the idea of advance. The whole of it denotes a gradual advance like the soaking in of water. The other two hexagrams that contain the idea of advance are number thirty-five, <strong><em>Advance of Consciousness </em></strong>and number forty-six,<strong><em>Pushing Upward</em></strong>-- each expresses its own nuance of meaning, and here the nuance is the gradual manner in which the advance takes place. </p>
     <p> The theme of the hexagram is the advance of men to offices in the state -- how it should take place gradually and by successive steps. Lines 2, 3, 4 and 5 are all in their proper places as dynamic or magnetic, and we ascend them as by regular steps to the top of the hexagram. </p>
     <p> The marriage of a young lady illustrates an important event which takes place according to various preliminary steps which must be correctly done in an orderly sequence. So must it be with the advance of a man in the service of the state. </p>
     <p> The K'ang-hsi editors say: <em>&quot;A tree springing up on the ground is a tree as it begins to grow. A tree on a hill is high and large. Every tree when it begins to grow shows its branches and twigs gradually becoming long. Every morning and every evening show some difference; and when the tree is high and great, whether it be of an ordinary or extraordinary size, it has taken years to reach its dimensions.&quot; </em></p>
     <p><strong>Added Commentary: </strong> Blofeld appends the following footnote to each line in this hexagram: it is easier to read it here as his general commentary. <em>[The additional Chinese commentaries explain that the wild goose is a bird which moves toward the sun. Now, a commonly used Chinese term for the sun is YANG, namely the male principle. So the bird obviously </em>(sic)<em> betokens a maiden seeking a husband. Its movement from river bank to rock, dry land, a tree, a hillock and the mainland (which is said in one commentary to mean peninsula) signifies gradual movement in an unchanging direction. From the point of view of divination, this is the best course for us, even if marriage is not our objective. Regarding marriage: the first line betokens gossip, although the marriage is not unsuitable; the second, a materially successful marriage; the third, an unfortunate marriage; the fourth, marriage to someone exceedingly kind and thoughtful; the fifth, a blissful marriage; the sixth, marriage to a public figure who has some responsibility for good order within the realm and who succeeds in his task.] </em></p>

     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Judgment: </strong> The proper union of forces within the psyche is a matter of slow maturation. </p>
     <p><strong> The Superior Man </strong> maintains his will and transforms the psyche. <em>&quot;Example is the school of mankind, and they will learn at no other.&quot;</em> -- Burke </p>
     <p> This is one of the most hierarchical of the hexagrams -- each line represents a clear advance from the position of the preceding line, thus giving an image of <strong><em>Gradual Progress.</em></strong> The vehicle of this progression is the wild goose, which also appears in every line. A goose is a bird -- primarily a creature of the air, or realm of thought; but because it also thrives on either water or land, the goose symbolizes thought which permeates the lower two categories of consciousness -- emotion (water), and sensation (earth). </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> Another traditional interpretation of the goose motif is that of the universal aspect of the soul. The wild goose is able to move about everywhere, on firm land, in water and in the air. It is the bird of Hermes, who is the leader of souls. <br>
         </em>E.C. Whitmont -- <strong><em>The Symbolic Quest </em></strong></p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p> The progress of the goose is a gradual one, from the shore, or threshold of awareness in line one, to the mountain heights, or realm of the Spirit in line six. The fact that this progress is linked with the idea of marriage in the Judgment is a clear hint that we are dealing here with the idea of the union of opposites within the psyche. (See commentary on hexagram number eleven.) The message is unambiguous: the process of psycho-spiritual growth is one of slow maturation. There are no short-cuts to enlightenment. </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> Evils and falsities must be removed, to the intent that a new life which is the life of heaven may be implanted. This can in nowise be done hastily; for every evil enrooted with its falsities has connection with all evils and their falsities; and such evils and falsities are innumerable, and their connection is so manifold that it cannot be comprehended ... From this it is plain that the life of hell in man cannot be suddenly destroyed, for if it were suddenly done he would straightway expire; and that the life of heaven cannot be suddenly implanted, for if this were done suddenly he would also expire. <br>
         </em>Swedenborg -- <strong><em>Arcana Coelestia</em></strong></p>

     <p class="style8"> Line-1 </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The first line, magnetic, shows the wild geese gradually approaching the shore. A young officer in similar circumstances will be in a position of danger, and be spoken against; but there will be no error. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong> The wild goose gradually draws near the shore. The young son is in danger. There is talk. No blame. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> The wild goose moves gradually towards the river bank. The younger son is in trouble. There is talk, but no error. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> The wild goose gradually approaches the shore. The boy is in danger. There is gossip. No blame. <em>[This line indicates difficulty, but you will ultimately be able to achieve your undertaking.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> The wild-swan Infiltrating tending-towards the barrier. The small son, adversity possessing words. Lacking fault. </p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy:</strong> The wild goose advances to the depths; for the little son dangerous; there are words; there is no trouble. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): </strong> Geese gradually proceed on the shoreline. The small ones are in danger; there is criticism, no fault. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2):</strong> Geese gradually proceed to the shoreline. If humble people are diligent and speak up, there is no blame. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu: </strong> The wild goose flies in gradually to rest by the riverbank. The little fellow is in jeopardy and he is being talked about, but without fault. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> The danger is owing to no fault of hers in the matter of what is right. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> The danger besetting the little son implies no blame. <strong>Blofeld:</strong> `The younger son is in trouble' is just a way of saying that there is trouble for which we are not to blame. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher: </strong> Righteous, without fault indeed. <strong>Cleary (2):</strong> The diligence of humble people is dutiful and blameless. <strong>Wu:</strong> In principle he is faultless. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> In line one the geese appear for the first time in the season approaching the shore. Then comes the real subject of the line -- she is magnetic in a dynamic place and without a proper correlate above. The difficulty and danger of her situation are seen as the result of circumstances -- the young officer has not brought it on herself. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> At the outset, the young man begins to make his way in the world. He is subjected to criticisms because his inexperienced steps are slow and hesitant. These will help prevent future errors on his part. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> Your position is one of the classic beginner. Criticism is now unavoidable, however -- it can be used to your advantage in refining your skills. You can lay down the early foundations for later successes. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> Air (thought) is more abstract than water (emotion); water is more abstract than earth (sensation). Of the three elements, earth is the most solid and the shore is where they all meet. As a creature at home in air, water or on land, the goose symbolizes a force which grounds an abstraction where it can be seen, grasped and understood. The young officer is inexperienced awareness coping with a new situation. <em>&quot;Danger&quot;</em> and being <em>&quot;spoken against&quot;</em> suggest confusion and conflicting emotions within the psyche as one deals with something new and unfamiliar. Remembering that the symbol of marriage in the Judgment relates to the union of thought and feeling within our physical vehicle, we can see that this first line represents a new synthesis of some sort. </p>

     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The second line, magnetic, shows the geese gradually approaching the large rocks, where they eat and drink joyfully and at ease. There will be good fortune. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> The wild goose gradually draws near the cliff. Eating and drinking in peace and concord. Good fortune. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> The wild goose moves gradually towards the rock. Eating and drinking happily -- good fortune. </p>

     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: </strong> They eat and drink joyfully, but not without having earned their food. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> He does not merely eat his fill. <strong>Blofeld: </strong> Good fortune in the form of delicate and plentiful food. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Not sheer satiation indeed. <strong>Cleary (2):</strong> They don&rsquo;t just stuff themselves idly. <strong>Wu:</strong> Not for the sake of gluttony. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The geese have advanced in line two, and so has the officer, though she is not mentioned. Line two is magnetic, humble and central, and has a proper correlate in the fifth line. Hence the good auspice. </p>

     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The third line, dynamic, shows the geese gradually advanced to the dry plains. It suggests also the idea of a husband who goes on an expedition from which he does not return, and of a wife who is pregnant, but will not nourish her child. There will be evil. The case symbolized might be advantageous in resisting plunderers. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong> The wild goose gradually draws near the plateau. The man goes forth and does not return. The woman carries a child but does not bring it forth. Misfortune. It furthers one to fight off robbers. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong> The wild goose moves gradually towards the dry land. The husband goes forth and does not return. The wife is pregnant, but the child's birth is delayed -- misfortune! This is an auspicious time for chastising evil-doers. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> The wild goose gradually approaches the highland. The man sets out and does not return. The woman is pregnant, but does not give birth. Misfortune.

     <p align="center"><strong> COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: </strong> The husband separates himself from his comrades. The wife has failed in her proper course. By resisting thieves men would preserve one another. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> He leaves the group of his companions. She has lost the right way. Devotion and mutual protection.<strong> Blofeld: </strong>The husband's failure to return symbolizes separation from our normal companions. Delayed childbirth symbolizes our going astray. The final sentence indicates willingness to take precautions for mutual protection. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher: </strong>Radiance flocking demons indeed. <em>[<strong>Demon(iac)</strong>, CH'OU: possessed by a malignant genius; ugly, physically or morally deformed: vile, disgraceful, shameful; drunken. The ideogram: fermenting liquor and soul...] </em>Letting-go her tao indeed. Yielding mutualizes protection indeed. <strong>Cleary (2):</strong> Leaving the group is disgraceful. The wife&hellip;loses the way. Harmoniously protecting one another.<strong> Wu: </strong>He separates from his comrades. She does not take the proper course. Because people would unite to protect one another. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Line three is dynamic, has passed the central place to the top of the lower trigram, and has no proper correlate in line six. He is likely to be violent and unsuccessful in his movements. He is like a husband who deserts his wife, or a wife who neglects her child. But in the case supposed, his strength in the end would be useful. <em>&quot;Separation from his comrades&rdquo; </em>means he finds no correlate. The wife fails in her proper course because the line is dynamic instead of magnetic, and has in addition passed the central position of balance. </p>

     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> The man goes too far and plunges into struggles beyond what is required by the natural laws of development. He loses his way. His life and family are jeopardized. He will regain his advantage if he does not provoke conflicts but uses his strength more in guarding his own position in line with his available resources and capabilities. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> If you provoke a conflict or make a bold and forceful advance, you will place yourself and those close to you in danger. This is a foolish risk indeed. You would be much wiser to allow things to develop naturally and, instead, secure what you have. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> This is an image of an aborted synthesis: we see <strong><em>Gradual Progress </em></strong>halted and dissipated in fruitless stagnation. <strong></strong><em>Goose:</em> Sensation and emotion under the influence of thought. <strong></strong><em>Dry Plains: </em>Infertile prospects: an area of futile speculation or endeavor. Wilhelm's rendering of &quot;plateau&quot; emphasizes a horizontal rather than vertical orientation -- reinforcing the image of no increase, no progress.<em> Husband and wife: </em> Union of thought and feeling, intellect and emotion. <strong></strong><em>Child: </em>The product, the ongoing evolution of thought and feeling within the psyche. <strong></strong><em>Plunderers: </em>Divisive, disruptive elements which bring about the separation of what is united. This estrangement brings a halt to the progress of the Work. Ritsema/ Karcher&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;Radiance flocking demons indeed&rdquo;</em> can represent inner complexes, phobias, compulsions, etc. The best course is to re-organize and defend yourself against further loss. Siu&rsquo;s paraphrase says it best. </p>

     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> Most translations emphasize that the use of the feathers is for ritual or sacred purposes. A feather used in religious ritual suggests spiritual thoughts, concepts, truths, aspirations, ideals, etc. <em>&quot;The large heights beyond&quot;</em> would be the realm of ultimate realities and eternal truths to which one aspires. Since one of the central ideas of the hexagram is the contracting of a marriage, this line suggests the consummation of that marriage, and the religious references indicate that it is a <em>hieros gamos</em>, or holy marriage. If we combine Legge's image of ornaments with the idea of religious rites, the Chinese concept of the proper attitude for sacrifice emerges: </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> In religious sacrifice ... the important thing is one&rsquo;s attitude, especially sincerity, in the performance. These sacrifices are &quot;ornaments&quot; or refined manifestations of an inner attitude. <br>

       <p> A. The image suggests a spiritual synthesis. Energy has been transformed -- the dialectical progression has been successful. </p>

       <p> C. A successful union of opposites. </p>
