     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> Fire over wood: the image of <strong><em>The Cauldron</em></strong>. Thus the superior man consolidates his fate by making his position correct. </p>

     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> The image of <strong><em>the Sacrificial Vessel</em></strong> shows us wood entering a fire, which suggests the idea of cooking. The sages cooked their sacrifices to God and nourished their able ministers with feasts. We have the trigrams of Flexible Obedience and Quick Intelligence, with the magnetic line advanced to the ruler's place and responded to by her dynamic correlate below. All these things give the auspice of successful progress. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The written Chinese character for <strong><em>Sacrificial Vessel</em></strong> represents a cauldron with three feet and two &quot;ears&quot; used for cooking and preparing food for both the table and the altar. The hexagram pictures this vessel -- the divided first line represents the feet, the three undivided lines above represent the body, the divided fifth line shows the ears (or carrying rings), and the top line is the handle by which the container is carried or suspended from a hook. </p>
     <p> The lesson of the hexagram is that the nourishing of men of talent and virtue intimates great progress and success. The K'ang-hsi editors point out that the distinction between hexagram number forty-eight, <strong><em>The Well</em></strong><em>,</em> and this one is the difference between the nourishment of the people in general and the specific nourishing of worthy men. They add that the reality of sacrifice is nourishing in this regard. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Judgment:</strong> You are the <strong><em>Sacrificial Vessel</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
     <p><strong> The Superior Man</strong> holds to the principles of the Work to attain transcendence. </p>
     <p> The usual name for this hexagram is <strong><em>The Cauldron</em></strong> -- specifically, a type of food-containing vessel which was used in ancient China for religious sacrifices. I prefer Blofeld&rsquo;s title of the <strong><em>Sacrificial Vessel</em></strong> as more evocative of the ideas presented in the figure. </p>
     <p> When the forty-ninth hexagram of <strong><em>Transformation</em></strong> is turned upside down, it becomes the fiftieth hexagram of the <strong><em>Sacrificial Vessel</em></strong>, thus giving us some valuable insights into the nuances of meaning in each of the figures. The combined ideas of transformation and a cauldron used for sacrifices remind us of the alchemical vessel or retort which &quot;cooked&quot; its contents and transformed them into a higher state of matter -- turned lead into gold in the popular conception. Of course, the true esoteric purpose of the alchemist was psychological, not physical. </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> The vessel of the alchemists, like the circle of the psyche and the mandala, must be closed if the transformation process is to proceed satisfactorily. For the alchemists, the process took place in the material substances collected in the retort. For us, this is a symbol representing a similar process taking place within the psyche. Thus it is said that a wall must be securely built about the psyche before the reconciliation of the opposites can take place within it, and before the new center of the individual can be created. ... For if anything is lost the process is nullified and the final product will be incomplete, imperfect. So long, for instance, as the individual continues to project his deficiencies, or his values, upon circumstances or upon another, he does not have an impervious vessel ... Thus the contents essentially involved in the transformation are seen to be the irrational, instinctual, not yet human factors of the psyche, the nonego. The human and civilized factors, those subject to the will, make up the wall of the vessel. <br>
         </em>M.E. Harding -- <strong><em>Psychic Energy</em></strong></p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p> Now an ancient Chinese cauldron used to contain food intended for religious sacrifices is not the same thing as a hermetically sealed alchemical retort made to withstand extreme pressures, but symbolically they are identical images. The ego sacrifices its autonomy for the good of the Work in the same way that the alchemist devotes his entire life to the transformation of base metal into gold -- i.e., to transform his psyche by following the extreme discipline of the Work. Thomas Cleary&rsquo;s <strong><em>Taoist I-Ching</em></strong> explicitly tells us that this is the meaning intended here: </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> The work of refinement is the means by which to sublimate earthly energy and stabilize celestial energy, causing the raw to ripen and the old to be renewed, whereby it is possible to illumine the mind and to solidify life. Therefore the cauldron is basically good and it has a developmental path. The basis is the potential of everlasting life of goodness; the cooking of the great medicine in the cauldron is the firing of this living potential to make it incorruptible and permanent. But in this path there is process and procedure; even the slightest deviation and the gold elixir will not form. Therefore people must first thoroughly investigate the true principle. <br>
         </em>Liu I-ming </p>

     </blockquote>

     <p align="center"><strong>SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION </strong></p>
     <p> In his commentary Legge mentions that the Chinese see an analogy between this figure and hexagram number forty-eight, <strong><em>The Well.</em></strong> Compare the two figures, noting the similarities between the first, third, fifth and sixth lines. The component trigrams of <strong><em>the Sacrificial Vessel</em></strong> appear in reverse sequence in hexagram number thirty-seven, <strong><em>Family</em></strong><em>. </em>What other similarities are there in the two figures? How is the idea of a family analogous to the idea of a sacrificial vessel? </p>
     <p class="style7"> Line-1 </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The first line, magnetic, shows the cauldron overthrown and its feet turned up. But there will be advantage in getting rid of what was bad in it. Or it shows us the concubine whose position is improved by means of her son. There will be no error. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> A cauldron with legs upturned. Furthers removal of stagnating stuff. One takes a concubine for the sake of her son. No blame. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> To rid it of decaying remnants of meat, the vessel is turned upside down. <em>[Some actions, though highly improper in themselves, may be properly performed if circumstances so require; a merely ritualistic conception of right and wrong is not desirable.]</em> It is not shameful to take a concubine for the sake of bearing sons. <em>[This is added as an example, immediately acceptable to a traditionally minded Chinese of something improper in itself which becomes proper when the motive is acceptable.]</em></p>
     <p><strong> Liu:</strong> A cauldron overturned by its legs -- it is beneficial to clean out the stagnating matter. One takes a concubine to get a son. No blame. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong><strong><em>The Vessel:</em></strong> toppling the foot. Harvesting: issuing-forth-from obstruction. Acquiring a concubine, using one's sonhood. Without fault. </p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy:</strong> The cauldron's upturned legs; beneficial to expel the bad; getting a consort together with her son; there is no trouble. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1):</strong> When the cauldron overturns on its base, it is beneficial to eject what is wrong. Getting a concubine, because of her child she is not faulted. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu:</strong> The cauldron tips over and conveniently spills its stale food, like a man taking a secondary wife because of her son. There will be no error. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> The cauldron is emptied -- this is not incorrect. There will be advantage in getting rid of what was bad so that the subject of the line will thereby follow the more noble subject of line four. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> This is still not wrong. To follow the man of worth<strong>. Blofeld:</strong> There is nothing improper about up-ending a sacrificial vessel to rid it of decaying matter. Such actions are necessary in the pursuit of what is noble. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Not-yet rebelling indeed. Using adhering-to valuing indeed. <strong> Cleary (2): </strong> That is not bad. To go along with what is valuable.<strong> Wu:</strong> There is nothing to worry about. The outlook is after prominence. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Line one is magnetic, and little can be expected from her, but she has a proper correlate in the dynamic fourth line. The overthrow of the cauldron, causing its feet to be turned upward towards the fourth place empties it of what was bad in it. This is deemed fortunate, because it thereby hastens the cooperation between the two lines. A similar idea is that a concubine is less honorable than a wife --like the overthrown cauldron. But if she has a son, while the wife has none, he will be his father's heir, and the concubine-mother will share in the honor of his position. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu:</strong> At the outset, the evil is being discarded. This opens up opportunities for renewal, no matter how lowly a position the man may temporarily occupy. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> To attain a goal that is worthy in itself, you may need to use means that are considered unorthodox. If this goal has been a long-term objective, you may have to begin again, using entirely new methods. This is not a mistake. You can succeed no matter how inexperienced you are. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> An alchemical vessel is a metaphor for the psyche undergoing the transformation of the Work. To rid the vessel of what is <em>&quot;bad&quot;</em> (Wilhelm calls it <em>&quot;stagnating stuff&quot;</em>) is to rid oneself of limiting beliefs, negative emotions or whatever harmful element may be suggested by the matter at hand. After years of work, the testing process becomes increasingly refined -- one goes through long periods of stress with perfect equanimity, and begins to take pride in one's strength of will. At about that point, something will happen to evoke an emotional response, and one becomes suddenly aware that the refining process is not complete until all of the scum comes to the top and is eliminated from the psyche. The symbolism of the concubine suggests a rather humble or simple emotional component, union with which produces a new and promising synthesis. </p>

       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> When this part of the work has been accomplished it is as if the individual had built a psychic container, and this must be done to the very best of his ability, or it may go to pieces when the strains and stresses of the transformation process begin. For there will still remain certain things, and these usually the very darkest, that will come to light when he explores the unconscious ... These blackest shadows, that the alchemists called the state of nigredo, will probably prove to be connected with the unadapted emotions representing the nonpersonal part of the psyche, and it is most painful to realize that they actually exist within oneself. <br>

       <p> A. After ridding oneself of limiting beliefs, a conscious connection with basic principles brings forth new and valuable insights. </p>

     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The second line, dynamic, shows the cauldron with the things to be cooked in it. If he can say, <em>&quot;My enemy dislikes me, but he cannot approach me,&quot;</em> there will be good fortune. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> There is food in the cauldron. My comrades are envious, but they cannot harm me. Good fortune. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> The Ting possesses solidity. My enemies are in difficulty and there is nothing they can do to me -- good fortune! </p>
     <p><strong> Liu:</strong> The cauldron is filled with food. My associates are jealous, but they cannot harm me. Good fortune. <em> [Even though a person profits from his business or performs his work carefully and well, he should still beware lest others harm or disturb him.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> The Vessel possesses substance. My companion possesses affliction. Not me able to approach. Significant. </p>

     <p><strong> Baynes:</strong> Be cautious about where you go.

After all there is no resentment.<strong> Wu:</strong> Be mindful of where to go. There will be no resentment in the end. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The enemy is the first line which solicits. Line two is able to resist the solicitation, and the auspice is favorable. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu:</strong> The man achieves great success, thereby incurring the envy of others. No harm will come to him, since he is not distracted from his purpose. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> You may feel a need to stand apart from your fellow man to achieve a significant aim. Such a stance will invite envy, but this will not create a problem for you. Good fortune is indicated. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> If the <strong><em>Sacrificial Vessel</em></strong> is seen as an analogue of the psyche, it is easy to see this line as a commentary on not allowing inner forces (appetites, passions, emotions, etc.) to overcome the ego's control of the Work. Note that the Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu translations are not conditional like Legge's: <em>&quot;If he can say...&quot;</em> Liu's note is derived from the Confucian commentary, which seems unduly grave: note that the original line is not overtly cautionary. Generally, you are protected despite any perceived threats. </p>

     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> There is the cauldron with the places for its ears changed -- he has failed in what was required of him in his situation. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> He has missed the idea<strong>. Blofeld:</strong> What is said about the handles of the Ting implies our failure in carrying out our duty. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Letting-go its righteousness indeed. <strong> Cleary (2): </strong> When the knobs of the cauldron are removed, it loses its meaning.<strong> Wu:</strong> It loses its usefulness. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Line three is dynamic in his proper place -- if his correlate were the magnetic line five, the auspice would be entirely good. But instead of five, his correlate is the dynamic six. What is required is that he and line five, instead of six, should be correlates. The place of the ears at five has been changed and the advance of line three is thereby stopped; the good meat in the cauldron will not be eaten. But if he keeps firm line five will eventually seek his company, the yin and the yang will mingle, and their union will be followed by the genial rain. The issue will be good. </p>

     <p><strong> Siu:</strong> The man is faced with obstacles. His abilities go unnoticed and talents unused. But this is only a temporary setback, as the tension will be relieved. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> Your unique talents are not being used because they are not recognized. This may be due to erroneous thinking on your part. Maintain a positive attitude about yourself, and things will change for the better. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> The Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu translations all refer to the <em>&quot;ears&quot;</em> as <em>&quot;handles.&quot;</em> We are justified therefore in combining the ideas of both. Ears are the organs by which we hear, and handles are devices by which something is grasped. To hear and to comprehend what is heard are the ideas conveyed. However, the ears have been changed or altered, so the image suggests that a different message or new set of rules and/or circumstances is now operative; the old rules or concepts no longer apply. The situation has evolved, but progress is stopped because one hasn't comprehended the changes yet. <em>&quot;The fat of the pheasant is not eaten&quot; </em>is just another way of saying that one has missed the point, or has not been nourished by the new insight. However, the situation will not remain static -- a coming union of thought and feeling will create the catharsis needed to effect the transformation. </p>

     <p><strong>The Master said:</strong><em>&quot;Virtue small and office high; wisdom small and plans great; strength small and burden heavy: where such conditions exist, it is seldom that they do not end in evil.

     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Line four is the minister charged with difficult duties. Although dynamic, he is in a magnetic position with a magnetic correlate in line one. Weak in himself, and without an able helper, he has failed to do his proper work, and cannot be trusted again. </p>

     <p><strong> Siu:</strong> The man fails to discharge his responsibilities because of personal inadequacies. Great plans supported by limited knowledge, heavy loads by meager strength, high office by weak character -- these result in shame and disaster. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> You do not have the capability to achieve the goals you have in mind. You have not been realistic about your position. You are lacking in either energy, commitment, information, or assistance. Going forth with your plans will invite disaster. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> The image suggests misfortune brought about by inexperience, incompetence, lack of capacity, divided loyalties, willful disobedience, or plain ignorance. In my experience, the line does not necessarily always imply blame: sometimes, with the best will in the world, one just isn't capable of coping with superior forces in a situation. If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram becomes #18, <strong><em>Work on What has been Spoiled</em></strong>, implying that you should clean up the mess you&rsquo;ve just made. </p>

     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: </strong> The central position of the line is taken as a proof of the solid virtue of its subject. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> The yellow handles of the cauldron are central, in order to receive what is real<strong>. Blofeld:</strong> The central position of this line in the upper trigram implies solid worth<strong>.

     <p><strong> Legge:</strong><em>&quot;Line five,&quot;</em> says the Daily Lecture, <em>&quot;praises the ruler as condescending to the worthy with his humble virtue.&quot;</em> Yellow has occurred repeatedly as a <em>&quot;correct color,&quot;</em> and here the yellow ears and strong rings of metal are intended to intensify our appreciation of the occupant of line five. As the line is magnetic, a caution is added about being firm and correct. </p>

     <p><strong> Siu:</strong> The man is modest and approachable. He thereby attracts associates, who can provide able help and advice. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> If he is humble and receptive, a person in a position of authority will make further progress in the development of his character. He will attain insights and wisdom. He should continue developing his expanding awareness. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> The Wilhelm version of the Confucian commentary gives us a more accessible clue as to the meaning of this line:<em> &quot;...In order to receive what is real.&quot; </em> The essential idea is that of the ruler's receptivity to a higher power. Openness to advice is the basic gestalt -- <em>&quot;ears&quot;</em> are receptive to messages, and <em>&quot;handles&quot;</em> suggest grasp or comprehension. Metal is often symbolic of the mental qualities, and yellow metal, rendered as <em>&quot;gold&quot;</em> in most translations of this line, suggests the highest form of mentality -- wisdom, divine intelligence, cosmic truth, etc. Gold also often symbolizes intuition, the highest form of comprehension. </p>

     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> The rings of jade are at the very top -- the dynamic and magnetic meet in their due proportions. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes</strong>: The jade rings in the highest place show the firm and the yielding complementing each other properly. <strong>Blofeld:</strong> The first part of the passage is indicated by this top line-- a firm line which meets the yielding fifth harmoniously<strong>. Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Solid and supple articulating indeed.<strong> Cleary (2): </strong> The jade handle is above. Hard and soft join.<strong> Wu:</strong> The strong and the weak are balanced. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Line six is dynamic, but his strength is tempered by being in a magnetic place. It is this which makes the handle to be of jade, which, though very hard has a peculiar and rich softness all its own. The auspice of the line is excellent. The Great Minister (line six) performs for the ruler (line five) by helping his government and nourishing the worthy. This is the part that the handle does for the cauldron. </p>

     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> The top line of a hexagram often represents the sage or holy man. Here the wisdom of the sage is offered to the ruler. Psychologically, the ego is receptive to instruction from its higher Self. The Confucian commentary alludes to the proper union of dynamic and magnetic forces -- this is the Holy Marriage of the Perennial Philosophy. The image suggests the Chinese concept of Li, the character for which combines the ideas of heaven's ordinances with that of a receptive vessel. </p>
