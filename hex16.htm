     <p><strong> Other titles:</strong> The Symbol of Harmonious Joy, <strong><em>Repose</em></strong>, Happiness, Providing-for/Provision, <strong><em>Excess</em></strong>, Merriment, Self-confidence, Contentment, Harmonize, Excitement, Intemperance, <strong><em>Self-deception</em></strong><em> &quot;Repose in the absolute confidence that the action now being taken is right.

     <p>&nbsp; </p>
     <p align="center"><strong> Judgment</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Legge: <em>Enthusiasm</em></strong> indicates that feudal princes may be set up and the army advantageously mobilized.</p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong><strong><em>Enthusiasm</em></strong>. It furthers one to install helpers and to set armies marching.</p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong><strong><em>Repose</em></strong> profits those engaged in building up the country and sending forth armies. <em>[This means that perfect certainty as to the rightness of our cause is of great value under the conditions mentioned. The usual meaning of this character is &quot;beforehand&quot; or &quot;happiness.&quot; In the English translation of Wilhelm's version, it appears as &quot;enthusiasm.&quot; &quot;Repose&quot; was suggested by the Chinese experts who kindly vetted this manuscript. At first I felt hesitant about adopting it, until I realized that, where it is used favorably, it must be understood as the kind of mental repose which follows absolute confidence that the action now being taken is the right one. In lines one, three and six, however, it clearly means failure to act when action is essential; in line five, failure to act owing to incapacity.]</em></p>
     <p><strong> Liu:</strong><strong><em>Happiness.</em></strong> It is of benefit to build up the country (or business), and send the army forth. <em>[Receivers of this hexagram should be wary of exhibiting excessive enthusiasm when beginning a new undertaking. If they are not, there will be misfortune. The hexagram also advises that everything necessary for advancement should be made ready. Then if an opportunity presents itself, it should be seized immediately, without hesitation.]</em></p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher: <em>Providing-for</em></strong> , Harvesting: installing feudatories to move legions.<em> [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of what is needed to meet the future. It emphasizes that accumulating strength through foresight and prudence so things can be fully enjoyed is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told to: provide-for!] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy: <em>Excess:</em></strong> Beneficial to establish a lord and to move troops.</p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1):</strong><strong><em>Joy. </em></strong>It is advantageous to set up a ruler and mobilize the army.</p>
     <p><strong> Wu:</strong><strong><em>Merriment</em></strong> indicates the advantage of establishing principalities and taking military actions. </p>
     <p>&nbsp; </p>
     <p align="center"><strong> The Image</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Thunder exploding out of the Earth -- the image of <strong><em>Enthusiasm</em></strong>. The ancient kings, in accordance with this, composed their music and honored virtue, offering it especially to God when they worshipped him at the service of their ancestors.</p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> Thunder comes resounding out of the earth: the image of <strong><em>Enthusiasm</em></strong>. Thus the ancient kings made music in order to honor merit, and offered it with splendor to the Supreme Deity, inviting their ancestors to be present.</p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong> This hexagram symbolizes thunder over the earth. The ancient rulers venerated heaven's gifts with solemn music and they sacrificed abundantly to the Supreme Lord of Heaven in order to be worthy of their ancestors.</p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> Thunder arising from the earth symbolizes <strong><em>Happiness.</em></strong> The ancient kings composed music to honor virtue, offering it to God and the spirits of their ancestors.</p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher: </strong> Thunder issuing-forth-from earth impetuously. <strong><em>Providing-for</em></strong>. The Earlier Kings used arousing delight to extol actualizing-tao. Exalting worship's Supreme Above. Using equalizing the grandfather predecessors. [<strong><em>Actualize-tao:</em></strong><em>ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is meant to be.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): </strong> When thunder emerges the earth stirs: Thus did the kings of yore make music to honor virtue, offering it in abundance to God, thereby to share it with their ancestors. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu: </strong> Thunder breaks out above the earth with a boom; this is <strong><em>Merriment. </em></strong>Thus the ancient kings used music to praise virtuous accomplishments and made grand offerings to the Supreme Being to be accompanied by their ancestors. </p>
     <p>&nbsp; </p>
     <p align="center"><strong> COMMENTARY</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: <em>Enthusiasm</em></strong> shows one dynamic line inspiring responsive obedience in all the others: devoted obedience takes action. Such obedient action conforms to natural law and creates order and discipline in the people. The planets and the seasons follow their natural cycles. The sages similarly obey the laws of their nature and the people acknowledge their regulations and punishments as just.</p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong><strong><em>Enthusiasm </em></strong>shows harmony and contentment throughout the kingdom -- a time when the people rejoice in their sovereign and readily obey him. At such a time his appointments and any military undertakings would be hailed and supported. Because he is close to the fifth place of dignity, the dynamic fourth line is seen as the chief executive officer of the ruler. The ruler has confidence in him, and all of the magnetic lines yield their obedience. Obedience is the attribute of the lower trigram which here takes the initiative and uses Movement, which is the attribute of the upper trigram.</p>
     <p> The symbolism of the Image is more obscure than usual. The use of music at sacrifices is supposed to assist in producing the union between God and his worshippers as well as the present and past generations. </p>
     <p>&nbsp; </p>
     <p align="center"><strong> NOTES AND PARAPHRASES</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Judgment:</strong> Delegate authority and gather your forces.</p>
     <p><strong> The Superior Man</strong> synchronizes his will with the intent of the Self via the principles of the Work.</p>
     <p><strong><em>Enthusiasm</em></strong> is the reverse of the preceding hexagram of <strong><em>Temperance</em></strong>. In <strong><em>Temperance </em></strong>we saw the calm strength of a mountain concealed within the earth. In <strong><em>Enthusiasm </em></strong>we see thunder exploding out of the ground into the sky: the strength that was formerly tempered and restrained is now released. It is significant to note that while every line of <strong><em>Temperance</em></strong> is more or less &quot;favorable,&rdquo; every line of<strong><em> Enthusiasm</em></strong> is either negative or cautionary -- even the generally positive fourth line carries a hint of warning about <em>&ldquo;doubt.&rdquo;</em></p>
     <p> Negatively,<strong><em> Self-Deception</em></strong> (the passion of True Believers) seems to be what this hexagram is portraying. The figure often suggests a callow or deluded buoyancy -- the kind of outlook associated with romantic idealists. In its most negative aspect, <strong><em>Enthusiasm</em></strong> is <strong><em>Intemperance</em></strong> -- the exact opposite of the moderation and restraint shown in the preceding hexagram. The behavior of an untrained Great Dane puppy suddenly bursting into a formal dinner party could be described as &quot;enthusiasm,&rdquo; but hardly a desirable form thereof. The lower trigram of Obedient Devotion has suddenly employed the action and energy of the upper trigram of Thunderous Shock to express itself. This is inconsistent with the code of the superior man.</p>
     <p> Conversely, in its most positive sense, <strong><em>Enthusiasm</em></strong> suggests the surety of total self-confidence. Blofeld translates this as <strong><em>Repose</em></strong>, explaining that the name was suggested to him by his Chinese advisors. We begin to understand this subtle distinction when we compare the seemingly obscure connection with music in the Image with a passage from Chuang- tse: </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> He who understands the music of heaven lives in accordance with nature in his life and takes part in the process of change of things in his death. In <strong>repose</strong>, his character is in harmony with the yin principle; in activity, his movement is in harmony with the yang principle. Therefore he who understands the music of heaven is not blamed by heaven or criticized by men ... It is said, &quot;In action he is like heaven. In repose he is like the earth ... Because his mind has found <strong>repose</strong>, therefore the creation pays homage to him.&rdquo;</em></p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p> To understand <em>&ldquo;the music of heaven&rdquo;</em> is to attain <strong><em>Repose</em></strong>, which is another way of describing the tranquility that comes with furthering the intent of the Self. The only dynamic line in the hexagram is in the minister's place just below the fifth-line ruler. He has the confidence of his sovereign and his actions therefore accord with heaven. We can turn to the Stoics to find an illustration of this idea:</p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> My will is simply that which comes to pass. For I esteem what God wills better than what I will. To Him will I cleave as His minister and attendant; having the same movements, the same desires, in a word the same will as He. <br>
         </em><em>--</em> Epictetus</p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p> Thus we see that the hexagram can describe either one of two opposite conditions -- the intemperate<strong><em> Enthusiasm</em></strong> of ego-confidence (a synonym for <strong><em>Self-Deception</em></strong>), or the calm<strong><em> Repose</em></strong> of true SELF-confidence. The fifteenth and sixteenth hexagrams, each the inverse of the other, represent magnetic and dynamic aspects of the same general idea: <strong><em>Enthusiasm</em></strong>, when it emanates from the Self, is just <strong><em>Temperance</em></strong> in action.</p>
     <p class="style6"> Line-1</p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The first line, magnetic, shows its subject proclaiming her pleasure and satisfaction. There will be evil.</p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong><strong><em>Enthusiasm</em></strong> that expresses itself brings misfortune.</p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong> The crowing of the cock bespeaks <strong><em>repose</em></strong> -- an evil omen! <em>[A sleepy cockcrow is not likely to bring men leaping from their beds, yet the traditional role of the cock is to sound the call to renewed action.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong><strong><em>Happiness</em></strong> that shows itself off brings misfortune.</p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Calling Provision<strong><em>.</em></strong> Pitfall. <em>[<strong>Provide(-for)/Provision</strong>, YU: ready, prepared for; prearrange, take precaution, think beforehand; satisfied, contented, at ease.]</em></p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy: </strong> Calling out in <strong><em>excess</em></strong>; inauspicious.</p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1):</strong> Trumpeting<strong><em> joy </em></strong>is inauspicious.</p>
     <p><strong> Wu: </strong> Crowing over <strong><em>merriment</em></strong> will be foreboding. </p>
     <p align="center"><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
     <p align="center"><strong> COMMENTARY</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> Her wishes have been satisfied to overflowing. <strong>Wilhelm/ Baynes:</strong> This leads to the misfortune of having the will obstructed. <strong>Blofeld: </strong> The evil mentioned in this passage is that which results from utter exhaustion of the will-power. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Purpose exhausted, pitfall indeed. <strong>Cleary (2): </strong>Trumpeting joy bodes ill when the aspiration reaches an impasse. <em>[The first yin harmonizes with the fourth yang above and rejoices in this; having no real qualities in oneself, only aspiring to cleave to others, how can one not come to an impasse?]</em><strong>Wu: </strong>Lacking aspiration will be foreboding.</p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Line one is magnetic, with a dynamic correlate in the fourth place. She may well enjoy the happiness of the time, but unable to contain herself, she erupts in boastful enthusiasm and calls undue attention to herself. <strong><em>Enthusiasm </em></strong>has thus been her undoing. </p>
     <p>&nbsp; </p>
     <p align="center"><strong> NOTES AND PARAPHRASES</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> At the outset, the man is enthusiastic and boastful.</p>
     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> Although you may have a harmonious connection with someone in a high position, it does not necessarily indicate that you are on top of the situation. Furthermore, if you boast of your advantage, you will surely invite disaster.</p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> The meaning here can be subtle. <em>Something</em> (a strong emotion or attitude perhaps) is upsetting one&rsquo;s equilibrium. In addition to the usual meaning of &ldquo;enthusiasm,&rdquo; this can symbolize any release or loss of energy (even despair, anguish, depression or grief &ndash; &ldquo;Anti-Enthusiasm,&rdquo; if you will), which serves to demolish<strong><em> Repose</em></strong>. Shaughnessy labels it <strong><em>Excess</em></strong>. Wilhelm and Blofeld render the Confucian commentary in terms of the <em>obstruction</em> or <em>exhaustion</em> of <em>willpower</em>. Ritsema/Karcher describe a <em>loss of purpose;</em> Cleary and Wu, <em>blocked aspiration.</em> If this is the only changing line, the hexagram changes to <strong><em>Shock, </em></strong>a plausible consequence in this case.</p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> But woe unto you that are rich! For ye have received your consolation. Woe unto you that are full! For ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! For ye shall mourn and weep. <br>
         </em><strong><em>Luke </em></strong> 6: 24-25</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p> A. A false sense of well-being &ndash; or, a false sense of despair. Examine the situation to determine where your conscious outlook or emotional response does not conform with the goals of the Work.</p>
       <p> B. Ego/Self <strong><em>Repose </em></strong>is obstructed by inappropriate belief.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p class="style6"> Line-2</p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The second line, magnetic, shows one who is firm as a rock. She sees a thing without waiting till it has come to pass; with her firm correctness there will be good fortune.</p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> Firm as a rock. Not a whole day. Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> Unmoved as a rock; before the end of day, righteous persistence will bring good fortune.<em> [Unmoved as a rock because of the repose which results from absolute confidence in a decision already taken.]</em></p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> Firm and stable like a rock. Do not wait a whole day. Continuing brings good fortune.</p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Chain-mail tending-towards petrification: Not completing the day. Trial: significant.</p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy: </strong> Scratched on a rock; not to the end of the day; determination is auspicious.</p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1):</strong> Firm as a rock, not procrastinating, rectitude is good.</p>
     <p><strong> Wu: </strong> He is upright like a rock. In less time than the passing of the day, he discriminates the good from the bad. To be persevering is auspicious. </p>
     <p align="center"><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
     <p align="center"><strong> COMMENTARY</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> This is shown by the central and correct position of the line. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong>Because it is central and correct. <strong>Blofeld:</strong> This is indicated by the suitable position of this line which is central to the lower trigram. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Using centering correcting indeed. <strong>Cleary (2):</strong></p>
     <p> It is balanced in the right way. <strong>Wu: </strong>Because he is central and correct.</p>
     <p><strong> The Master said:</strong><em>&quot;Does not he who knows the inception of things possess spirit-like wisdom? The superior man, in his intercourse with the high, uses no flattery, and, in his intercourse with the low, no coarse freedom: does not this show that he knows the inception of things? Those beginnings are the slight stirrings of movement, and the earliest indications of good fortune or ill. The superior man sees them, and acts accordingly without waiting for the delay of a single day. As is said in the <strong>I Ching</strong>, `He is firm as a rock, and acts without waiting for the delay of a single day. With firm goodness there will be good fortune.' Firm as a rock, how should he have to wait a single day to ensure his knowing those beginnings and his course? The superior man knows the minute and the manifested; he knows what is weak, and what is strong: he is a model to ten-thousand.&quot;</em></p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The magnetic second line is in her correct central position in the lower trigram. Quietly and firmly she is able to abide in her place and exercise a far-seeing discrimination. All is indicative of good fortune. </p>
     <p>&nbsp; </p>
     <p align="center"><strong> NOTES AND PARAPHRASES</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> The man is quiet, but firm as a rock, yet sensitive to the first imperceptible signs of impending changes. He does not delay in taking action.</p>
     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> To be able to recognize the early signs of a change in fortune is a tremendous gift. While others may be swept away by compelling rhythms and fads, you adhere firmly to the underlying principles of your nature and react appropriately to the demands of the time. Such is the behavior of leaders.</p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> All translations except Legge and Cleary's render the second sentence in the imagery of <em>&quot;not waiting for a whole day to pass,&rdquo;</em> which suggests action taken on the basis of foresight, premonition or intuition. This line is sometimes an injunction to follow your common sense -- saying in effect, that an oracle is unnecessary to proclaim the obvious.</p>
     <p align="center"><em> You don't need a weatherman to know </em></p>
     <p align="center"><em> which way the wind blows. </em></p>
     <p align="center"> -- Bob Dylan</p>
     <blockquote>
       <p> A. Proper discrimination knows when to act, and when to refrain from action.</p>
       <p> B. Your own intuition already knows the answer to your query.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p class="style6"> Line-3</p>

     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: </strong> This is intimated by the position not being the appropriate one. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong>The place is not the appropriate one. <strong>Blofeld: </strong> This is indicated by the line's unsuitable position. <strong>Ritsema/ Karcher: </strong>Situation not appropriate indeed. <strong>Cleary (2): Wu: </strong>Because his position is improper.</p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> Line three is magnetic in a dynamic place. She looks upward and depends upon the ruling line above while she does nothing herself but indulge in pleasure. Unless she changes her attitude, the auspice is bad. </p>

     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> The man looks upward for favors and continues his dependency upon others. He indulges in visions of pleasure and affluence. Unless he changes immediately, he will be sorry.</p>
     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> You have waited complacently for a cue from someone else to motivate you. Whatever the reasons for your hesitation, whether it is idle pleasure in the present or simply inertia, you are losing your independence and self-reliance. You can still save yourself. Move.</p>
     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> This line is magnetic when the times call for dynamic action, giving us an image of indolent dependency. Without doing anything, she wants to &quot;have her cake and eat it too.&rdquo; Sometimes one receives this line when in a state of despair: feeling as if abandoned to one's fate by an incomprehensible cosmos. The idea is that fate isn't going to make the transition for you: you must do it yourself.</p>

     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The fourth line, dynamic, shows him from whom the harmony and satisfaction come. Great is the success which he obtains. Let him not allow suspicions to enter his mind, and thus friends will gather around him.</p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> The source of <strong><em>enthusiasm</em></strong>. He achieves great things. Doubt not. You gather friends around you as a hair clasp gathers the hair.</p>

     <p align="center"><strong> COMMENTARY</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> His aims take effect on a grand scale. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong></p>
     <p> His will is done in great things.<strong> Blofeld: </strong> The first sentence indicates the fullest attainment of our will. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Purpose: the great moving indeed. <strong>Cleary (2):</strong> The aspiration is carried out greatly. <strong>Wu:</strong> His aspirations are fully realized.</p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The dynamic subject of line four is the agent to whom the happy condition is owing, and it is only necessary to caution him to maintain his confidence in himself and his purpose. His adherents and success will continue.</p>
     <p><strong> Anthony: </strong> The source of enthusiasm is in believing in our path and its ultimate success, because it is correct. We gather friends and helpers when this belief is strong enough that we do not try to convince people or contend with them. Contending comes from the ego, which secretly disbelieves. </p>
     <p align="center"><strong><em> &nbsp;</em></strong></p>
     <p align="center"><strong> NOTES AND PARAPHRASES</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> The man is confident, free of suspicions of others, and sincere in his dedication. He instills harmony and satisfaction among his associates. People gather around him in effective cooperation.</p>
     <p><strong> Wing:</strong> Harmonious times are approaching. It is safe to exhibit your confidence in the future. Your attitude will attract others to you, who will co-operate in your endeavors. In this way you can accomplish great deeds.</p>
     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> As the only dynamic line in the hexagram, line four is considered to be its ruler. When we note that Legge mentions <em>&quot;harmony and satisfaction&quot;</em> instead of <em>&quot;enthusiasm,&quot; </em>we begin to see the meaning behind Blofeld's title of <strong><em>Repose</em></strong>. Indeed, his translation of the line begins: <em>&quot;From repose, great results accrue...&quot;</em> Wilhelm's version gives the idea of consolidating forces <em>&quot;as a hair clasp gathers the hair.&quot;</em> Psychologically interpreted, a process of integration is symbolized. The line can sometimes be a gentle admonition to have faith in your own unconscious processes to advance the Work.</p>

     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The fifth line, magnetic, shows one with a chronic complaint, but who lives on without dying.</p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong> Persistently ill, and still does not die.</p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong> Illness is presaged, but it will not last long or cause death.</p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> Long illness, but still living.</p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher: </strong> Trial: affliction. Persevering, not dying.</p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy: </strong> Determination is illness; if constant you will not die.</p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): </strong> There is a persistent illness, but one never dies.</p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2):</strong> Chaste in illness, one never dies.</p>
     <p><strong> Wu:</strong> It is like having a persistent illness, but not fatal. </p>
     <p>&nbsp; </p>
     <p align="center"><strong> COMMENTARY</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> She is mounted on a dynamic line in the central position, and her memories of the past have not yet perished. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> It rests upon a hard line. That it nevertheless does not die is due to the fact that the middle has not yet been passed.<strong> Blofeld: </strong> Illness is indicated because this yielding line comes immediately above a firm one. Recovery rather than death is to be expected because this line is, nevertheless, central to the upper trigram. <strong> Ritsema/Karcher: </strong>Trial: affliction. Riding a solid indeed. Persevering, not dying. Center not-yet extinguished indeed. <strong>Cleary (2):</strong> Being chaste in illness means riding on firmness. Never dying means not losing balance. <strong>Wu: </strong>Because its position remains central.</p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> Line five is magnetic in the place of a dynamic ruler, and in danger of being carried away by the lust of enthusiasm. Her proximity to the powerful influence below is a source of danger. Hence she is represented as suffering from a chronic complaint. </p>
     <br>
     <p align="center"><strong> NOTES AND PARAPHRASES</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> The man is continually complaining. Yet the very struggling against the daily troubles constitutes his immediate incentive for living.</p>
     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> Total harmony is obstructed and impossible. Yet the very awareness of this will keep you from sinking again into chaos and eventual defeat.</p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> Here enthusiasm is obstructed. A man is under constant pressure, which prevents him from breathing freely. However, this pressure has its advantage &ndash; it prevents him from consuming his powers in empty enthusiasm. Thus constant pressure can actually serve to keep one alive.</p>
     <p><strong> Anthony:</strong> The situation is difficult and uncomfortable. We are still under the influence of striving to achieve results or hedging to prevent them. However, our discomfort is useful in causing us to seek out these attitudes which block our progress.</p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> At its most neutral, the image suggests a chronic condition currently not amenable to being cured. Sometimes this feels like ironic irritation: the oracle seems to be asking: &quot;When are you ever going to learn?&rdquo; The ego is clinging to outmoded ways (the <em>&quot;memories&quot;</em> mentioned in Legge's Confucian commentary), and is yet unable to fully comprehend the demands of the Work. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes #45, <strong><em>Gathering Together,</em></strong> with a corresponding line hinting that the source of our illness may be less-than-pristine dedication. <strong>Cleary (2):</strong> &ldquo;<em>Gathering around the position, there is no blame. If those who are not loyal remain ever-faithful to their original commitment, regret vanishes.&rdquo;</em></p>

     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject with darkened mind devoted to the pleasure and satisfaction of the time. But if she changes her course even when it may be considered as completed, there will be no error.</p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong> Deluded <strong><em>enthusiasm</em></strong>. But if after completion one changes, there is no blame.</p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> Madcap <strong><em>repose</em></strong>. Fortunately a change takes place, so no blame is involved. <em>[Madcap repose implies being tardy to the point of extreme rashness in the face of approaching danger or of a need to act.]</em></p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> Deluded <strong><em>happiness</em></strong>. Change after completion. No blame.</p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher: </strong> Dim <strong><em>Providing-for</em></strong>. Accomplishment: possessing denial. Without fault.</p>

     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> How can one in such a condition continue for long? <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> Deluded enthusiasm in a high place: how could this last? <strong>Blofeld: </strong> Since this is a top line, the state of madcap repose cannot possibly last long. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Dim Providing-for located above. Wherefore permitting long-living indeed? <strong>Cleary (2):</strong> Oblivion in joy is at the top. What can last? <strong>Wu: </strong>How can the situation continue for long?</p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The magnetic sixth line at the end of the hexagram is all but lost. </p>
     <p> The action of the figure is over, and if she postpones changing her evil ways any longer, there is no hope remaining for her. However, there is still a chance of safety if she will but change. </p>

     <p align="center"><strong> NOTES AND PARAPHRASES</strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu: </strong> The man is distracted by pleasure and satisfaction. If he changes after the events of the day have run their course, however, the sober awakening will prevent future errors.</p>
     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> The person in this position is lost in the memory of a compelling and harmonious experience. The time is past, and what is left is empty egotism. Fortunately, reform is possible. There is an opportunity to move on to a situation of new growth.</p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> This line has a similar auspice as that of its (improper) correlate in line three. Wilhelm's commentary states: <em>&quot;A sober awakening from false enthusiasm is quite possible and very favorable.&quot;</em> Note that &ldquo;no blame&rdquo; is mentioned, suggesting that you are more ignorant than culpable in the situation at hand.</p>
