     <p align="center" class="style7"> COMPENSATING SACRIFICE </p>
     <p><strong> Other titles:</strong> Decrease, The Symbol of Lessening, Loss, Diminishing, Reduction, Diminution of Excesses, Decline, Bringing into Balance, Dynamic Balance, Sacrifice, <em>&quot;Not necessarily material loss. Can mean decreasing the lower self to increase the higher.&quot;</em> -- D.F. Hook </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>Judgment </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong><strong><em>Compensating Sacrifice</em></strong> means that sincerely maintained rectitude brings great success. Action is appropriate if one's sacrifice is sincere -- even two baskets of grain, though there be nothing else, may be offered. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong><strong><em>Decrease</em></strong> combined with sincerity brings about supreme good fortune without blame. One may be persevering in this. It furthers one to undertake something. How is this to be carried out? One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong><strong><em>Loss</em></strong> accompanied by confidence -- sublime good fortune and no error! It is favorable to have in view some goal (or destination). If there is doubt as to what to use for the sacrifice, two small bowls will suffice. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu:</strong><strong><em>Decrease</em></strong> with sincerity: great good fortune, no blame. One may continue. It is beneficial to go somewhere. How can this (decrease with sincerity) be done? One may use two bamboo containers of grain for a sacrifice. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher: <em>Diminishing,</em></strong> possessing conformity. Spring significant. Without fault, permitting Trial. Harvesting: possessing directed going. Asking-why: having availing of. Two platters permit availing-of presenting. <em>[This hexagram describes your situation in terms of sacrifice and loss. It emphasizes that lessening yourself and decreasing your involvements is the adequate way to handle it...] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy:</strong> There is a <strong><em>return;</em></strong> prime auspiciousness; there is no trouble. It can be determined. Beneficial to have someplace to go. Why use two tureens; you can use aromatic grass. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): <em>Reduction</em></strong> with sincerity is very auspicious, impeccable. It should be correct. It is beneficial to go somewhere. What is the use of the two bowls? They can be used to receive. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2): </strong> &hellip; It is beneficial to have somewhere to go, etc &hellip; They can be used for presentation. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu: <em>Loss</em></strong> indicates that with confidence there will be great fortune, no error, perseverance, and advantage to have undertakings. What to use in offerings? Two boxes of grain are adequate. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>The Image </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The image of a mountain and beneath it the waters of a marsh form <strong><em>Compensating Sacrifice.</em></strong> The superior man, in accordance with this, restrains his wrath and represses his desires. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong> At the foot of the mountain, the lake: the image of <strong><em>Decrease</em></strong>. Thus the superior man controls his anger and restrains his instincts. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> This hexagram symbolizes a marshy lake at the foot of a mountain. The Superior Man keeps his anger under control and is moderate in his desires. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> The lake beside the mountain symbolizes <strong><em>Decrease</em></strong>. The superior man curbs his indignation and restricts his desires. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher: </strong> Below mountain possessing marsh. <strong><em>Diminishing</em></strong>. A <em>chun tzu</em> uses curbing anger to block the appetites. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): </strong> There is a lake under a mountain,<strong><em> reducing</em></strong> it. Thus does the superior person eliminate wrath and cupidity. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2): </strong> Lake below a mountain &ndash; <strong><em>Reducing</em></strong>. Thus do developed people eliminate anger and greed. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu:</strong> There is a marsh below the mountain; this is <strong><em>Loss</em></strong>. Thus the <em>jun zi </em>mitigates his anger and restrains his desires. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> In <strong><em>Compensating Sacrifice</em></strong>the lower trigram is diminished to increase the upper, and the flow is upward. The two baskets of grain accord with the time. There is a time when the strong should be diminished and the weak strengthened. Decrease and increase, overflowing and emptiness, take place in harmony with the demands of the time. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> Ch'eng-tzu says: <em>&quot;Every diminution and repression of what we have in excess to bring it into accordance with right and reason is comprehended under <strong>Compensating Sacrifice</strong>. If there is sincerity in doing this it will lead to success and happiness, and even if the offering is small, yet it will be accepted.&quot; </em></p>
     <p> The K'ang-hsi editors say:<em> &quot;What is meant by diminishing in this hexagram is the regulation of expenditure or contribution according to the time. This would vary in a family according to its poverty or wealth, and in a state according to the abundance or scantiness of its resources. If one supplements the insufficiency of his offering with the abundance of his sincerity, the insignificance of his two baskets will not be despised.&quot; </em></p>
     <p> The waters of a marsh are continually rising up in vapor to bedew the hill above it, and thus increase its verdure. What is taken from the marsh gives increase to the hill. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Judgment: </strong> A sacrifice creates equilibrium. </p>
     <p><strong> The Superior Man </strong> sacrifices his appetites to a higher principle. </p>
     <p> The traditional name for this hexagram is <strong><em>Decrease,</em></strong> but the lines and commentary all describe a compensating exchange of forces to attain equilibrium. The idea of &quot;sacrifice&quot; is mentioned in the Judgment, and that also might make a good title, though the image of two baskets of grain suggests a balancing scale: a &quot;compensating&quot; device. In this hexagram, the flow of energy moves from below upwards -- the waters of the lake or marsh are dispersed to enrich the mountain. In psychological terms we think of the ego sacrificing or decreasing its autonomy to achieve psychic equilibrium with the Self: we forfeit something valuable to obtain something even more valuable. Without this <em>quid pro quo,</em> the concept of sacrifice is meaningless and irrational. </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> A sacrifice is meant to be a loss, so that one may be sure that the egoistic claim no longer exists. Therefore the gift should be given as if it were being destroyed. But since the gift represents myself, I have in that case destroyed myself, given myself away without expectation of return. Yet, looked at in another way, this intentional loss is also a gain, for if you can give yourself it proves that you possess yourself. Nobody can give what he has not got.<br>
         </em> Jung -- <strong><em>Transformation Symbolism in the Mass</em></strong></p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p> Compare the Image message from hexagram number 15, <strong><em>Temperance</em></strong> with the notion of a compensating balance: <em>&quot;The superior man, in accordance with this, diminishes his excesses to augment his insufficiencies, thus creating a just balance.&quot; </em>We are reminded of another &quot;Temperance&quot; -- the 14th Arcanum of the Tarot, which depicts an angel pouring water from one vessel into another: &quot;compensating.&quot; A comparison of its symbolism with that of hexagram number 41 yields many insights: </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> The Path of ... TEMPERANCE, leads from ... the Personality [ego] to the Higher Self ... The whole experience is one of preparation of the Personality [ego], and the body in which it is operating, to deal with an influx of Light which would be devastating to a system unready to handle such energy. Most important here is the monitoring of progress, the continual testing from above. It is the angel here which is at once the Higher Self and the initiatory forces of Nature, which pours the elixir from vase to vase. This is an ongoing process of testing; measuring to see how much the physical vehicle can bear. <br>
         </em>R. Wang --<strong><em>The Qabalistic Tarot</em></strong></p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p> Without belaboring the point, we can see that all sacrifice is a kind of remuneration: it couldn't be otherwise in an interconnected universe. The Image instruction for the superior man to &ldquo;control his anger&rdquo; is also echoed in the Temperance card. This relates to: </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> ...an aspect of the Mysteries only rarely discussed, and certainly germane to the Twenty-Fifth Path </em> [the Kabbalistic equivalent of the relationship between lines one and four in this hexagram]:<em> this is the very real hostility often felt by the student toward the Path itself, as he works day after day and seems to be getting nowhere. Such hostility and frustration is in itself a major test; it is part and parcel of the work prior to the emergence of inner proofs. -- <strong>Ibid</strong></em></p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p><em>&quot;Decrease with sincerity&quot;</em> (Liu) refers to one's continuous sacrifice for the goals of the Work, and <em>&quot;curbing anger&quot;</em> (Ritsema/Karcher) is how one handles the archetypal forces evoked when the decrease seems endless and you've yet to receive anything in return. Like any other hexagram, <strong><em>Compensating Sacrifice </em></strong>can symbolize an infinity of possible situations, but psychologically speaking we can first regard it as an image of sacrifice for the purpose of attaining a balance of power within the psyche. Without the sacrificial devotion of the ego, the Self cannot attain its will; and if the Self can't make it, the ego is doomed by default. </p>
     <p class="style7"> Line-1 </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The first line, dynamic, shows its subject suspending his own affairs, and hurrying away to help the subject of the fourth line. He will commit no error, but let him consider how far he should contribute of what is his for the other. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong> Going quickly when one's tasks are finished is without blame. But one must reflect on how much one may decrease others. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong> To hurry away when work is done is not wrong, but first consider whether such a hasty departure will harm the work. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> To go quickly after the work is done brings no blame. One should consider how much the decrease will be. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Climaxing affairs, swiftly going. Without fault. Discussing Diminishing it. </p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy: </strong> Already serving the ends in going; there is no trouble; toasting decreases it. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1):</strong> Ending affairs, going quickly, there is no fault; but assess before reducing something. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2):</strong> &hellip; Assess the reduction of this. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu:</strong> He stops doing his own things, and swiftly goes forward. There will be no blame. He should consider limiting the loss. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge: </strong> The subject of the fourth line mingles her wishes with his. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong>The mind of the one above accords with one's own. <strong>Blofeld: </strong>Moreover, the approval of our superiors must first be obtained. <strong>Ritsema/ Karcher:</strong> Honoring uniting purposes indeed. <strong>Cleary (2): </strong>Valuing unification of aims. <strong>Wu: </strong>He does what pleases the above. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Line one is dynamic and his correlate in line four is magnetic. He wants to help her, but won't leave anything of his own undone in doing so. Nor will he diminish anything of his own for her without due deliberation. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu:</strong> At the outset, the man disregards his own interests to help his superior. The latter should be sensitive to the amount of such help that can be accepted without harm to the subordinate. Neither should a subordinate give without due consideration. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> When you are in a position to help others or to be helped yourself, be certain that moderation is exercised. To give or take too much can result in an imbalanced situation. Think this through carefully before acting. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> The full meaning of this line is best evoked by comparing it with its fourth line correlate. This is an image of less than total support. It says: &quot;Render all due assistance.&quot; It is left up to you to differentiate the appropriate amount, which is a hint that a test may be involved. (<em>&quot;...Let him consider how far he should contribute of what is his for the other&quot;</em> can sometimes imply a warning about slavish service to archetypal powers.) When compared with the image of line four, we get a definite picture of an active balancing of forces &ndash; perhaps a dialectical process. The Self is demanding a differentiation from the rational ego. This is a complex line which often implies messages which are literally impossible to put into words. </p>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p align="justify"><em> Principally he must know how far he is willing to go, what he is willing to sacrifice. There is nothing more easy to say than everything. A man can never sacrifice everything and this can never be required of him. But he must define exactly what he is willing to sacrifice and not bargain about it afterwards. <br>
             </em>Gurdjieff </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p> A. An image of judicious choices to attain proper balance or equitable compensation of forces. </p>
       <p> B. How much are you willing to give to the Work? (Be careful with your answer!) </p>
       <p> C. Render aid to &quot;the one above.&quot; (The Self.) </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p class="style7"> Line-2 </p>
     <p><strong> Legge: </strong> The second line, dynamic, shows that it will be advantageous for its subject to maintain firm correctness, and that action on his part will be evil. He can give increase to his correlate without taking from himself. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> Perseverance furthers. To undertake something brings misfortune. Without decreasing oneself, one is able to bring increase to others. </p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld: </strong> Persistence in a righteous course brings reward, but to advance (or go anywhere) now would bring misfortune. This is not a time for decreasing but for augmenting. </p>
     <p><strong> Liu: </strong> To continue is beneficial. Undertakings bring misfortune. Without decrease, without increase. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Harvesting Trial. Chastising: pitfall. Nowhere Diminishing, augmenting it. </p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy:</strong> Beneficial to determine; to be upright is inauspicious. Not decreasing it, but increasing it. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1): </strong> It is beneficial to be correct. An expedition is inauspicious. No reduction or increase of this. <em>[If you do not know when enough is enough and go on reducing and increasing, you will reactivate the human mentality and thus obscure the mind of Tao &hellip; It is because the strong energy is balanced, not biased or lopsided, that there is no more reduction or increasing to be done.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2):</strong> &hellip; Increase it without reduction. </p>
     <p><strong> Wu:</strong> It is advantageous to be firm and correct, but foreboding to go ahead. His decision of not taking a loss will benefit the other. <em>[It may be justifiable for the below to support the above in a very moderate way in time of Loss, but it would be unacceptable by asking the below to give up all of its possessions &hellip; to satisfy the above.] </em></p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> His central position gives its character to his aim. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> It has the correct mean in its mind. <strong>Blofeld:</strong> The central position of this line in the lower trigram indicates that persistence will be rewarded by the fulfillment of what is willed. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher: </strong>Centering using activating purposes indeed. <strong>Cleary (2):</strong> The balance that characterizes its aim. <strong>Wu:</strong> He is to remain central. </p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Line two is dynamic and in the central place. But he is in the place of a magnetic line, and should maintain his position without moving to help his fifth line correlate. Maintaining his own firm correctness is the best way to give assistance. <em>&quot; His aim&quot;</em> is to abide where he is and help the fifth line by the exhibition of firm correctness. </p>
     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center"><strong>NOTES AND PARAPHRASES </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Siu:</strong> The man renders faithful service without sacrificing himself. Forfeiting one's dignity and personality to do the bidding of a person of high rank is shameful. </p>
     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> When aiding others, be certain to maintain your sense of dignity. If the nature of your task diminishes your strength or compromises your principles, or if you sacrifice your personality to please your superior, you are acting shamefully. Only efforts that do not diminish your Self are worthwhile. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> This line changes the hexagram to number twenty- seven, <strong><em>Nourishing,</em></strong> the corresponding line of which carries a similar message, i.e., the idea that one's impetus to act is incorrect. Lines one and three each show some variation of active compensating (balancing) going on. Here in line two, which is the center of the lower trigram, action is inappropriate. It is the fulcrum or point of balance which must remain stationary. Note the subtle differences in the various translations of the last sentence. You decide. </p>

     <p align="center"><strong>COMMENTARY </strong></p>
     <p><strong> Confucius/Legge:</strong> When three are together, doubts arise among them. <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes:</strong> If a person should seek to journey as one of three, mistrust would arise. <strong>Blofeld: </strong>It is well to travel alone now, as three would give rise to suspicion. <strong>Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Three by-consequence doubting indeed. <strong>Cleary (2):</strong> When one person travels, three then doubt. <strong>Wu: </strong>Three would create doubts. </p>
     <p><strong>The Master said:</strong><em> &quot;Heaven and earth come together, and all things take shape and find form. Male and female mix their seed, and all creatures take shape and are born. In the<strong> Book of Changes</strong> it is said: `When three people journey together, their number decreases by one. When one man journeys alone, he finds a companion.' This refers to the effect of becoming one.&quot; </em></p>
     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> Chu Hsi says that the lower trigram was originally three yang lines, like &quot;three men&quot; walking together, and that the third line was removed and made into the topmost line of the upper trigram which was originally three yin lines. This exchange of places between lines three and six maintains their proper correlation and suggests the proper pairing of affinities. The K'ang-hsi editors observe that this line is true not only of three men, but of many repetitions of thought or action. </p>

     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> The original condition described by Chu Hsi is an image of hexagram number eleven, <strong><em>Harmony,</em></strong> which represents the correct union of male and female forces. Psychologically the <em>Syzygy </em>archetype is suggested: the proper pairing of male and female which is seen in its supreme state in the <em>hieros gamos</em> or holy marriage. (See commentary on hexagram eleven for further detail.) A dialectical process is also implied. </p>

     <p><strong> Wing: </strong> If you can now locate your shortcomings and bad habits and make a serious attempt to decrease them you will be approached by friends and helpers. A humble attitude on your part will open the way to progressive interaction and joy. </p>
     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> The full meaning of this line is best evoked by comparing it with its first line correlate. All translations render line four in the imagery of decreasing one's faults (or illness). That is: rid yourself of error and happiness will come to you. Legge's version depicts incapacity which is overcome through a correct union with line one. Taken in this sense, the line can symbolize the Self (line four, upper trigram of Heaven) gaining from the ego's sacrifice in spacetime (line one, lower trigram of Earth). Whatever the context of your query, the image here is of a harmonization of forces to bring about balance. </p>

     <p><strong> Editor:</strong> The most ancient method of divination in China involved the use of tortoise shells (Plastromancy). The yarrow stalk and coin methods didn't come into vogue until after King Wen committed the <strong><em>I Ching </em></strong>to writing. At the time that this line was composed then, to receive ten pairs of tortoise shells was a very numinous gift -- perhaps equivalent to &quot;having God on your side.&rdquo; The <em>&quot;blessing from above&rdquo;</em> is mentioned by some commentators as a reference to the oracles obtained through divining with the tortoise shells, and could be construed as an endorsement of your interpretative skills. This line changes the hexagram to number sixty-one,<strong><em>Inner Truth,</em></strong> the corresponding line of which expresses the idea of a beneficial synthesis of forces. </p>

     <p><strong> Legge:</strong> The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject giving increase to others without taking from himself. There will be no error. With firm correctness there will be good fortune. There will be advantage in every movement that shall be made. He will find ministers more than can be counted by their clans. </p>
     <p><strong> Wilhelm/Baynes: </strong> If one is increased without depriving others, there is no blame. Perseverance brings good fortune. It furthers one to undertake something. One obtains servants but no longer has a separate home.<em> [Through perseverance and zealous work a man wins success and finds helpers as they are needed. But what he accomplishes is not a limited private advantage; it is a public good and available to everyone&hellip; There are loyal helpers, but not for promoting family interests.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Blofeld:</strong> Gain which causes no loss to others involves no error. Persistence in a righteous course brings good fortune. It is favorable to have in view some goal (or destination). He obtains followers but not a family (or home). </p>
     <p><strong> Liu:</strong> If one increases (gains) without anyone decreasing (losing), no blame. To continue brings good fortune. It is beneficial to go somewhere else; one will find a helper after leaving home. </p>
     <p><strong> Ritsema/Karcher:</strong> Nowhere Diminishing, augmenting it. Without fault. Trial: significant. Harvesting: possessing directed going. Acquiring a servant, without dwelling. </p>
     <p><strong> Shaughnessy:</strong> Not decreasing it, but increasing it; there is no trouble; determination is auspicious; there is someplace to go; obtain a servant without family. </p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (1):</strong> Not reducing or increasing this is faultless. Correctness brings good fortune. It is beneficial to go somewhere. Getting a servant, there is no house. <em>[The mind of Tao is the master, the human mind is the servant. When the mind of Tao is in charge of things, every step, every undertaking, is celestial design; personal desires do not arise, and even the human mind transforms into the mind of Tao: &ldquo;getting a servant, there is no house&rdquo; &hellip; This is returning to ultimate good by reduction.] </em></p>
     <p><strong> Cleary (2): </strong> Increase without reduction, and there will be no blame. Correctness leads to good results. There is somewhere to go. Getting an administrator without a house. <em>[To increase the third yin, it is necessary not to reduce the top yang. This is because the third yin as an administrator is in the position of &ldquo;losing one&rsquo;s home in the service of the country,&rdquo; but the top yang perceives the sincerity of this lone journey, so this is &ldquo;great attainment of the objective,&rdquo; and the third yin considers this &ldquo;getting companionship.&rdquo; This is called &ldquo;increase without reduction.&rdquo;] </em></p>

Ch'eng-tzu says on line six: <em>&quot;Dwelling on high and taking nothing from those below him, but on the contrary giving more to them, the superior man accomplishes his aim on a grand scale.

     <p><strong> Editor: </strong> There is a conceptual disagreement between Legge's rendition of this line and that of the other translators. Legge:<em> &ldquo;increasing others while not decreasing oneself.&rdquo; </em>Wilhelm: <em>&ldquo;increasing oneself without decreasing others.&rdquo;</em> Cleary&rsquo;s Buddhist version is the most neutral:<em> &ldquo;increase without reduction.&rdquo;</em> My understanding of the hexagram is that it depicts a process of active compensation -- the continuous give and take of life which maintains a fair equilibrium: neither pole imbalances the other. Psychologically interpreted, the sentence about the <em>&ldquo;servant but no home,&rdquo; </em>suggests the creation of a kind of Psychic Commonwealth in which all the complexes have become integrated enough to abandon their partisan interests and serve the intentions of the Self. The ego as an administrator or servant is essential for the attainment of this. </p>
